            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>DIſſenters</hi> are accuſed of <hi>Schiſm</hi> by ſome of this Church, both theſe and the other are branded not only as <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> but as <hi>Hereticks</hi> by the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> who upon this account judge us unworthy to live, and had actually deſtroyed <hi>both</hi> together, if <hi>God</hi> in Mercy had not diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d their deviliſh <hi>Plot.</hi> The diſcovery gave them ſome interruption, and put them upon an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-game, to retrieve what had miſcarryed. And this was ſo to <hi>divide</hi> us, as that <hi>our ſelves</hi> ſhould help them in their deſign to <hi>ruine us all,</hi> when they had leſs hopes to do it <hi>alone.</hi> In purſuance hereof ſuch influence they have had upon too many, as to raiſe in them a greater averſation to <hi>Diſſenters</hi> than to <hi>Papiſts.</hi> Theſe the <hi>Conſpirators</hi> count their own, and think they may well do ſo, ſince
<pb facs="tcp:95960:3"/> they are too ready to concurre with them in their deſign to exterminate thoſe, who are <hi>true Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in every point,</hi> and differ no more from this <hi>Church</hi> than thoſe in <hi>France</hi> do, who by the <hi>ſame</hi> Counſels are at this time in extreme danger to be utterly extirpated. Others are ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with as to make uſe of one of the ſharpeſt weapons they have againſt diſſenting Proteſtants, and that is the charge of <hi>Schiſme,</hi> lately renewed and re-inforced.</p>
            <p>In theſe hard circumſtances, while we do what we can againſt the <hi>common Enemy,</hi> we are put to ward off the blows of ſuch as (notwithſtanding ſome preſent diſtemper) we will count our <hi>Friends.</hi> Amongſt other expedients, ſufficient to ſecure us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this attaque, it was thought not unuſeful, to anſwer the <hi>allegations out of Antiquity,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two points, wherein only the <hi>Antients</hi> were made uſe of to our prejudice, viz. 1. For <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Churches,</hi> and then 2ly. Againſt <hi>the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Biſhops by the people</hi> in the primitive times. Something was performed and publiſhed in reference to both theſe in a late diſcourſe. One half
<pb facs="tcp:95960:3"/> of which, where the latter is diſcuſſed, concerning the <hi>popular Elections of Biſhops,</hi> hath yet paſſed without any exception that I can ſee or hear of; yet this alone is enough to defend us againſt the aforeſaid charge: For thoſe who will not make the <hi>primitive</hi> Church <hi>Schiſmatical,</hi> must not condemn any as <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> for declining ſuch <hi>Biſhops</hi> as that Church would not own.</p>
            <p>Againſt the former part of the Diſcourſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Dioceſan Churches,</hi> ſome exception hath been made, but very little; a late <hi>Author</hi> in his <hi>Preface</hi> to a Treatiſe of another Subject, hath touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about 5 pages in 40. but ſo as he hath done them no more harm, than another, who to find one fault therein, runs himſelf into two or three, about <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, render'd <hi>indefinitely</hi> according to the mind of the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi> who uſes it, and the moſt common uſe of it.</p>
            <p>I diſparage not the <hi>Gentleman's</hi> Learning who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taques me in his Preface, he ſhews that which, (with anſwerable care and Judgment,) might be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in a cauſe that deſerves it. But much more than he ſhews, would not be enough to ſupport what he would establiſh. And he might have forborn the
<pb facs="tcp:95960:4"/> vilifying of thoſe, who are known to be <hi>Maſters</hi> of much more valueable Learning, than appears in either of us. The neglect of ſome accurateneſs in little things, remote from the merits of the cauſe, in one who is not at leiſure to <hi>catch flies,</hi> is no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he is destitute of Learning.</p>
            <p>I complain not of his proceeding with me; but am obliged by him, that he treats me not with ſo much contempt as he does others, who leſs deſerve it. I wiſh he had dealt more temperately with M. B. it would have been more for his reputation, and no prejudice to his undertaking; a <hi>good</hi> cauſe, when it hath a <hi>ſufficient</hi> Advocate, does not need any undecent ſupplements.</p>
            <p>After I have cleared my Diſcourſe front this <hi>Gentleman's</hi> exceptions, I thought it not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to ſhew what in reaſon cannot be counted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent proofs of <hi>Dioceſan Churches;</hi> that if any will purſue this debate farther, instead of oppoſing us, they may not <hi>beat the Air,</hi> and amuſe thoſe that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after truth; with what is inſignificant. Withal I have given an account of what other alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations out of Scripture and Antiquity this Author
<pb facs="tcp:95960:4"/> hath brought in other parts of his Treatiſe for ſuch Churches; and ſhew'd that there is no evidence in them, as to the purpoſe they are alledged for.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I find nothing in this <hi>Author,</hi> or any other before him, which may ſatisfie a judicious and impartial man, that in the <hi>two firſt Ages</hi> of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity any Biſhop had more than one particular Church or Congregation for his proper charge; or that in <hi>the third Age,</hi> there was any Biſhop which had a Church conſisting of more than are in ſome one of our <hi>Pariſhes,</hi> unleſs it was the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> (nor is there ſufficient evidence produced for that:) Or that in <hi>the middle of the fourth Age</hi> there were 4 Churches, each of which compriſed more than could aſſemble in one place (though if they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained more, that might be far enough from making them Dioceſans;) Or that afterwards, within the <hi>time of the four firſt General Councils,</hi> where there were ſeveral Churches belonging to one Biſhop, he did exerciſe jurisdiction over them alone, or only by himſelf and his Delegates. It will be time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to cenſure us as <hi>Schiſmaticks</hi> for declining <hi>Dioceſan Churches,</hi> when they have made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear,
<pb facs="tcp:95960:5"/> that there was ſuch, in the best ages of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity: (which not appearing, the cenſure falls upon the <hi>primitive</hi> Christians, from whom it will <hi>ſlide</hi> of upon themſelves.) If they will forbear us, till this be performed, we need deſire no more. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we may prevail with thoſe who ſincerely profeſs themſelves <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to regard the ſecuring themſelves and their <hi>Religion</hi> from the destructive deſigns of the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> more than <hi>thoſe things</hi> which are not <hi>properly</hi> the concern either of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> or of <hi>Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for thoſe who prefer the <hi>Papiſts</hi> before <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters,</hi> and revile theſe as worſe, though they differ in no one point of Religion from other true <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants:</hi> We need not wonder if we meet with no better treatment from them, then from declared Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists; ſince by ſuch preference they too plainly declare the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> to be <hi>worſe than Popery,</hi> in their account. The following ſheets have lain by me many Months, and had done ſo still; but that the importunity of ſome, and the miſrepreſenting of my ſilence by others, forced me to publiſh them.</p>

So that herein the caſe is not diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; And the deſign of that number of Officers might partly be for other Congregations, (Epiſcopal Churches, though not Dioceſan) to furniſh them with Officers. This is apparent afterwards in the practice of the <hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Churches,</hi> who when a new Church was erected, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed it with a Biſhop or other Aſſiſtants from places bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtored with Officers; And it is exemplyfied particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly (as we ſhall ſee hereafter) in the proviſion which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> made for <hi>Fuſſala.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He ſayes further, the multitude of Presbyters belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one Congregational Church, might be occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd by the uncertain abode of moſt of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> who are the Principal, if not the only Ordainers of Presbyters mentioned in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:95960:6"/>
            <p> But herein he does but gueſs, and had no reaſon to be poſitive, unleſs the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Commiſſioners,</hi> (as he calls them,) had been then the only Ordainers, which he will not venture to affirm, knowing what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence there is againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Laſtly, he ſayes, if this opinion of <hi>Biſhop Downham</hi> had any certain ground in Antiquity, we ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably hear of it with both eares, and we ſhould have it recommended upon antienter Authority than his.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This of <hi>Biſhop Downham</hi> hath certain ground in the beſt antiquity, if the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> be ſuch; where it is plain there were many Presbyters in diverſe Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, ſuch as are not yet, nor ever will be proved to be <hi>Dioceſan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To that of <hi>Nazianzen;</hi> he ſayes, <q>it hath received its anſwer, and adds, he that cannot anſwer it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from the great difference between the condition of the Church in <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and in <hi>Nazianzen</hi>'s time, hath a fondneſs for the Argument.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This is the anſwer it received, <hi>Pag.</hi> 51. and this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was thus expreſſed a little before; <q>But that any Church ſixt and ſetled, having its Biſhop alwayes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, ſhould multiply Presbyters <hi>beyond neceſſity,</hi> in the circumſtances of the Primitive Chriſtians before <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</hi> is altogether incredible; for the neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the Church were very great, the poor nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, the generality of Chriſtians not of the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the Eſtates they had being at the diſcretion of their enemies, and ruin'd with perpetual perſecution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> He ſayes, multiplying Presbyters <hi>beyond neceſſity,</hi> and <hi>without neceſſity;</hi> while he alters my words ſo as to change the ſenſe, he diſputes againſt himſelf, not me; But this looking more like an Argument than any thing before, I ſhall take a little more notice of it. 1. Is not all this applicable to the Churches in the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s times,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:95960:7"/> when it cannot be denyed <hi>Presbyters</hi> were multiplyed beyond what we count neceſſary? <hi>The poor numerous, the generality of Christians not of the Richeſt,</hi> and <hi>the Eſtates they had being at the diſcretion of their enemies, and ruin'd with perpetual perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, the Church before <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> particularly, ſuppoſing theſe to be its circumſtances, might have many Presbyters without any great charge: For 1ſt. the Church Stock was reſerved <hi>only</hi> for thoſe in <hi>want,</hi>

            <p>Having ſhew'd out of <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> that 60 Presbyters belonged to the great Church in <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and thence inferr'd they were numerous in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, the <q>number (ſayes he,) was become extravagant in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinians</hi> time; but what is this to their number in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian's?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>He ſhould have asked the <hi>Dean</hi> this, who to prove <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Churches from the number of Presbyters, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Teſtimonies out of <hi>Cyprian,</hi> brings this of <hi>Justinian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>For this very edict of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſhews that this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of Church Officers was an innovation, and <hi>there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> would have them reduced to the firſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Juſtinian</hi> took order to retrench the numbers of Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, not <hi>therefore</hi> becauſe it was an <hi>innovation,</hi> but becauſe the Church revenue could not maintain ſo many, which is expreſs in the <hi>Novel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But that firſt eſtabliſhment it ſeems admitted great numbers, for one Church had 60. <hi>True;</hi> but it muſt alſo be noted firſt, that theſe 60 were to ſerve more than one Church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some may be ready to ask how it can be <hi>true,</hi> that one Church ſhould have 60, and yet more than one had theſe 60 amongſt them.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:95960:8"/>
            <p>
               <q>For there were three more beſides St. <hi>Sophia</hi> to be ſupplyed by theſe Presbyters. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>True; but this ſtill confirms what I anſwer'd to their argument from the multitude of Presbyters, that in the antient Church the Officers were multiplyed <hi>above what we count needful:</hi> For it is not now thought needful that any 3 or 4 Churches in a City, ſhould have 60 Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, 100 Deacons, 90 Subdeacons, Readers 110. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Yet after all, there is no argument to be drawn from this number, for theſe were <hi>Canons</hi> of a particular foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, deſign'd for the ſervice of a <hi>Collegiate</hi> Church; and no meaſure to be taken from thence concerning the numbers of Presbyters belonging to the Dioceſs. This is evident from the Preface of the ſaid <hi>Novel.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If no argument is to be drawn from this number, why did the <hi>Learned Dean</hi> draw one from it? 2ly. This ſeems ſcarce conſiſtent with the former Period: there, theſe Presbyters were for 3 <hi>or</hi> 4 <hi>Churches,</hi> here they are but for <hi>one Collegiate</hi> Church of which they were <hi>Canons,</hi> and this ſaid to be evident in the <hi>Preface,</hi> where I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee it. 3ly. <hi>Since no meaſure is to be taken from hence concerning the numbers of Presbyters belonging to a Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs;</hi> it ſeems there may be this number of Presbyters in a place which cannot be counted a <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> (as this one great Church never was, nor can be) and then no argument drawn from the number of Presbyters at <hi>Rome, Carthage, Edeſſa, &amp;c.</hi> will prove a <hi>Dioceſan Church;</hi> for here was the greateſt number, which any where we meet with.</p>

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:95960:8"/> proof of a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church was evinced ſufficiently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: this fell in occaſionally, and was added <hi>ex abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danti;</hi> Yet upon this ſupernumerary ſtragler he turns his main force, ſpending about 12 Pages on it. I am little concerned what becomes of it, ſince the main Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis is already ſecured by the premiſſes; but that this Gentleman may not quite looſe all his labour, I am willing to looſe a little, in taking ſome notice of it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I muſt confeſs that what is added concerning the Church of C. P. is ſomewhat ſurprizing, no doubt ſayes he, that the Presbyters were <hi>more numerous</hi> in C. P.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed it might have been ſurprizing if I had ſaid as he reports me, that they were <hi>more numerous;</hi> but I ſaw reaſon not to ſay ſo, though what reaſon there was to impoſe it on me I know not: I cited <hi>Soc:</hi> miſprinted <hi>Soz.</hi> ſaying, <hi>Conſtantine built two Churches at C.

               <hi>It is true,</hi> he ſayes <hi>not that he built no more than two,</hi> but his expreſſion plainly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes it, and he was concerned if he had known any more to have mention'd it, when in the ſame Line, he ſayes <hi>Conſtantine</hi> intended to make it equal to <hi>Rome.

               </gap>, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Churches, (not very many as he will have it) but if he thereby meant more than are named by <hi>Socrates,</hi> we need not underſtand that done before the time <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſpeaks of; Nor ſhould a lax expreſſion be more relyed

            <p>But if we ſhould ſuppoſe that <hi>Sozomen</hi> intended more than 3 or 4 Churches, or that the <hi>Emperour</hi> built no more than was requiſite, and only conſulted convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and deſign'd not State or Magnificence, (which yet our Author a little after ſayes he did; and we know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more ordinary than for great Cities to have more Churches than are needful: it was ſo in <hi>London</hi> before the Fire, and the retrenching of their number ſince ſhews it:) yet this will be ſo far from proving <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Church in <hi>C.

He <hi>dares to affirm they had a Conventicle</hi> or more, for he affirms they had an eminent Biſhop in <hi>C.

            </p>
            <p>I did not ſay <hi>Theodoret affirms they were no more, than could meet in one Church,</hi> but he ſayes the ſame in effect, viz. that <hi>all the Brethren aſſembled with</hi> Alexander. His words are, <hi>Alexander, the Church rejoycing, hcld an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly with all the Brethren, praying and greatly glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God.</hi> The words are plain, and the ſenſe, I take them in, is open in the face of them. Nor do I believe that any diſintereſted perſon would put any other ſenſe upon them than this, that <hi>the generality of Chriſtians of which the Church at</hi> Conſtantinople <hi>conſiſted, aſſembled together with their Biſhop</hi> Alexander, <hi>to praiſe God joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for their deliverance by the death of</hi> Arius. But he will not have the words <hi>taken in a general ſenſe,</hi> but <hi>will ſuppoſe them taken with reſpect to that particular Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, in which</hi> Arius <hi>was to be reconciled.</hi> Yet this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition hath no ground either in the words, or in the contexture of the Diſcourſe, or any where elſe that I know of, or our <hi>Author</hi> either; for if he had, we ſhould have heard it <hi>with both ears,</hi> as he ſpeaks elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where.

            <p>This looks more like a ſhift than a plain anſwer, and therefore he was well adviſed in not venturing to own it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Theodoret</hi> could not think that all the Beleivers of C. P. could come together to the Biſhop's Church, for he cites a Letter of <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s a little after, where he gives an account of the great increaſe of that Church.</q> 
               <hi>In the City that is call'd by my name by the Providence of God, an infinite multitude of People have joined themſelves to the Church, and all things there wonderfully increaſing, it ſeems very requiſite that more Churches ſhould be built; underſtanding therefore hereby what I have reſolved to do, I though fit to order you to provide</hi> 50 <hi>Bibles fairly and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gibly written.</hi>

               </gap>, that there was a <hi>very great multitude of Chriſtians</hi> is not denied, nor that he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>build more Churches;</hi> but this confirms what is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified before, that theſe <hi>very many Churches</hi> were not yet built, but only in deſign, and that with a proſpect of Chriſtians there ſtill increaſing. And the <hi>Bibles,</hi> if they were intended only for C. P. might be for the future Churches, not the preſent only.</p>
            <p>His Concluſion is, <q>where Chriſtians were ſo multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that it was neceſſary to build more Churches, and to make ſuch proviſions for the multitude of their Aſſemblies, it could not be that they ſhould all make but one Congregation.</q>

            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:95960:13"/>
            <p> He ſhould have concluded that which is denied, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe all he hath premiſed will be inſignificant, and to no purpoſe: it is granted that all the Chriſtians at C. P. did make more than <hi>one Congregation,</hi> and for their conveniency met at other times in ſeveral Churches. That which is denied is, that the main Body or genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Chriſtians there could not meet in one Aſſembly, or did not ſo meet at this time with their Biſhop <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander,</hi> as to this he hath proved nothing, and therefore did well to conclude nothing againſt that which is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be the plain import of <hi>Theodoret</hi>'s expreſſion.</p>
            <p>And it may be ſuppoſed that <hi>Theodoret,</hi> if he had not expreſſed it, <hi>might well think</hi> (though the contrary be ſuggeſted) that as great multitudes, as <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Letters ſignified, might meet together at the Biſhop's Church; for himſelf declares what a vaſt Congregation he preached to at <hi>Antioch,</hi> having an Auditory of <hi>many Myriads</hi>

            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Narciſſus</hi> having retired, and the people not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what had become of him, the neighbouring Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops ordained <hi>Dius</hi> in his place, who was ſucceeded by <hi>Gordius</hi> and after by <hi>Germanico,</hi> (it ſhould be by <hi>Germanico,</hi> and after by <hi>Gordius)</hi> in whoſe time <hi>Narciſſus</hi> returned, and was deſired to reſume his Office, and did ſo. What became of <hi>Germanico</hi> (he means <hi>Gordius,)</hi> is not ſaid but probably he reſigned or died preſently.</q>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing to make either of theſe probable, it is altogether as likely, if not more, that he continued Biſhop there with <hi>Narciſſus</hi> for ſome time; but becauſe <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſayes nothing of it, I inſiſt not on it. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides he tells us, Narciſſus <hi>took</hi> Alexander, <hi>into the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of the charge.</hi> That ſignifies <hi>Narciſſus</hi> was not excluded from the Epiſcopal <hi>charge,</hi> both had their parts therein. No, but ſayes he, Alexander <hi>was the Biſhop,</hi> Narciſſus <hi>retained but the name and title only,</hi> that is, he was but a Titular, not really a Biſhop, and why ſo? becauſe <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>joined with him in prayers, and the Hiſtorian ſayes he was not able to officiate by reaſon of his great age.</hi> He was not able it may be to perform all the Offices of a Biſhop, but what he was able to do no doubt he performed. Now if they muſt be but <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tular</hi> Biſhops, who perform not perſonally all the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices

To have depoſed him for his great age had been a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Act, and ſuch as the Church in thoſe times cannot be charged with. No doubt but he retained the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal power, though through Age he could not exerciſe it in all inſtances; and if he had not only the <hi>Title</hi> but the <hi>Power,</hi> he was really a Biſhop, and there were two Biſhops at once in one Church, and then this inſtance is ſo far from being <hi>moſt diſadvantageous,</hi> that it ſerves me with all the advantage I deſigned in alledging it.</p>
            <p>As for the words of <hi>Valeſius</hi> cited by him, if they be taken in the ſenſe which our <hi>Author</hi> would have them, that <hi>learned man</hi> will not agree with himſelf. For but a very few lines before, he ſays, theſe two were <hi>Co-Epiſcopi, Biſhops together</hi> in that City, <hi>ſuperſtite epiſcopo, adjutor &amp; coepiſcopus est adjunctus,</hi> And tho' he ſays (but ſays it doubtfully with a <hi>ni fallor)</hi> this was forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at <hi>Sardica</hi> (above 100 years after); yet he adds that, <hi>notwithſtanding it was ſtill uſual in the Church, nihil ominus identidem in eccleſia uſurpatum eſt,</hi> which is all, that I need deſire. And afterwards, where <hi>Euſebius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">in <hi>l.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 32.</note> again mentions two Biſhops in one City, he obſerves, that in one of his Copies, the <hi>Scholiaſt</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, <hi>here alſo there were two Biſhops of one Church. Valeſius</hi> adds, <hi>the Scholiaſt underſtands</hi> Alexander, <hi>who was Biſhop of</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>together with</hi> Narciſſus.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:95960:16"/>
            <p> The next inſtance is of <hi>Theotecnus</hi> and <hi>Anatolius</hi> who were Biſhops of <hi>Caeſarea</hi> together. Againſt this he hath little to ſay, I ſuppoſe becauſe nothing can be ſaid againſt it in reaſon. Only he ſeems willing that <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ſhould paſs but as <hi>Epiſcopus deſignatus,</hi> whereby if he mean one, who is not yet actually a Biſhop, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be one hereafter, as <hi>Eradius</hi> was by <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> it is inconſiſtent with what <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſayes and himſelf quotes, but one line before, viz. <hi>that</hi> Theotecnus <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained him Biſhop in his life-time;</hi> for if he was not <hi>actually</hi> Biſhop after he was thus ordained, he was never Biſhop at all <note n="m" place="margin">

            <p>He would not have <hi>Maximus</hi> to be Biſhop while <hi>Macarius</hi> lived, becauſe it is ſaid <hi>he was to rule the Church after his Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Maximus</hi> was to govern the Church not only after his death, if he ſurvived him (as he was like to do being much younger) but while he lived; and ſo did actually together with him, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>I alledged <hi>Epiphanius, who ſignifies that other Cities had two Biſhops together, and excepts only</hi> Alexandria. To which he anſwers, <hi>that</hi> Epiphanius <hi>cannot mean that all other Cities had two Biſhops at a time,</hi> nor did I ſay that he meant this, but his expreſſion imports no leſs than that it was <hi>uſual for other Cities to have two Biſhops.</hi> Nor is there any reaſon to think that <hi>Epiphanius</hi> reſpects only
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95960:16"/> the caſes alledged; it was quite another caſe that was the occaſion of his words; and diverſe other inſtances might be brought of a different nature and occaſion, though this be ſufficient to ſhew, that the rule againſt two Biſhops in one City was not <hi>inviolable:</hi> He adds, <q>I do not ſee what advantage can be made of this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This <hi>paſſage</hi> ſhews that there was commonly two Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in a City at once, <hi>Alexandria</hi> is only excepted as varying herein from other Cities. And this is <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage</hi> enough <hi>for me,</hi> and it is enough <hi>againſt him</hi> too; and leaves no reaſon for his pretence that it was only in <hi>extraordinary caſes.</hi> I affirmed it <hi>could not be</hi> Epiphanius <hi>his meaning (as a great Antiquary would have it) that</hi> Alexandria <hi>was never ſo divided, as that ſeveral parties in it ſhould have their reſpective Biſhops there,</hi> and brought ſeveral Inſtances to evince it: <hi>for ſo it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided in the time of</hi> Epiphanius, <hi>when the Catholicks had</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>the</hi> Arians <hi>had</hi> Gregorius, <hi>and then</hi> Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius; <hi>and afterwards the one had</hi> Peter <hi>the other</hi> Lucius, <hi>and the</hi> Novatians <hi>had their Biſhops ſucceſſively in that City till</hi> Cyril<hi>'s time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>He anſwers however I do not ſee why that learned <hi>Antiquarie's</hi> opinion may not be maintained againſt this Gentleman's objections, he ſayes that <hi>Alexandria</hi> was divided before <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his time between ſeveral Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops (I ſaid in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>'s time) it cannot be denied. But that is not the thing <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſpeaks of, but that before the Election of <hi>Theonas</hi> againſt <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> there were never two oppoſite Biſhops as in other Churches.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But this doth neither <hi>agree</hi> with the one nor <hi>defend</hi> the other; it agrees not with <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> but makes him contradict himſelf, for he tells us there were two oppoſite Biſhops at <hi>Alexandria</hi> before <hi>Theonas</hi> was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:95960:17"/> For this was not till <hi>Alexander</hi>'s death, but he ſayes <hi>Piſtus</hi> was made Biſhop there by the <hi>Arians</hi> while <hi>Alexander</hi> was living <note n="o" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>They are fully <hi>ſignificant,</hi> both in reference to the <hi>Antiquary</hi> againſt whom they are brought to prove that he miſtook <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> when he would have it to be his meaning, that <hi>Alexandria</hi> was never ſo divided as to have two oppoſite Biſhops; for they ſhew it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſo divided: and alſo in reference to <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> they were ſo late as his time on purpoſe, to ſhew more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably, that could not be his meaning, which was againſt his knowledge, and notorious inſtances in his own time.</p>
            <p>But he will not deny the <hi>inſtance of the Novatians to be ſignificant, only</hi> Socrates <hi>does not ſay that they had their Biſhops ſucceſſively to</hi> Cyril<hi>'s time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor do I ſay he does; but he ſayes Cyrill <hi>ſhut up the</hi> Novatian <hi>Churches there, and took away all the ſacred treaſure in them, and deprived their Biſhop</hi> Theopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus <hi>of all he had.</hi> Now when our <hi>Author</hi> meets with Churches, and a <hi>Biſhop</hi> over them; he is not wont to queſtion a <hi>Succeſſion,</hi> unleſs it appears he was the firſt.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It may be they began there after this time, for there is little Account in Church-Hiſtory, that I know, of any <hi>Novatians</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> before <hi>Athanaſius,</hi>

            </p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:95960:17"/>
            <p> We are little concerned about this, yet it may be they began before this time, <hi>for there is no account at all in Church Hiſtory, that the</hi> Novatians <hi>began there in, or after</hi> Athanaſius <hi>his time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I had produced evidence that many <hi>African Biſhops</hi> declared, in the caſe of <hi>Valerius</hi> and <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that it was <hi>uſual</hi> in all parts, to have two Biſhops in a City at once; to this he anſwers, <q>but ſuppoſe all this true, that this might be maintained by the Examples of ſeveral Churches, what is it that two Biſhops may be in one Church? no, that is not the matter, but that a Biſhop when he growes old, may appoint or ordain his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour, to <hi>prevent the mischiefs, that are uſually produced by popular Elections.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If what the <hi>African Biſhops</hi> did alledge, were reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that particular <hi>caſe</hi> he contends for; yet this is enough to make good all I intend, viz. that <hi>uſually</hi> in the antient Church, there <hi>were two Biſhops together in one place.</hi> For when one is ordained Biſhop in the ſame place, when another is ſtill living; with whatever deſign, upon what occaſion ſoever this is done, yet there are two Biſhops at once in the ſame place.</p>
            <p>I ſee no reaſon why this ſhould be reſtrained to that <hi>particular caſe,</hi> the occaſion of what the Biſhops affirm may clear it, and that was <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s ſcruple, not to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Valerius,</hi> but to be made Biſhop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> while his Biſhop there was living, <hi>Epiſcopatum ſuſcipere, ſuo vivente Epiſcopo, recuſabat,</hi> for ſo there would be two together, which he took to be againſt the Cuſtom of the Church, <hi>contra morem Eccleſiae;</hi> but they all perſwade him that this was uſually done, <hi>id fieri ſolere,</hi> and prove it by examples in all parts <note n="q" place="margin">

            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:95960:18"/>
            <p> When he aſſigns this as the reaſon of appointing a Succeſſour, to <hi>prevent the miſchiefs that are uſually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by popular elections,</hi> he ſpeaks his own ſence, not theirs; for they were better adviſed than to brand the general practice of the ancient Church as <hi>miſchievous,</hi> and how this ſuggeſtion becomes one, who undertakes to write a <hi>vindication of the Primitive Church,</hi> let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf conſider.

               </gap> it was forbidden by a <hi>rule</hi> of the <hi>Nicene Council, Quod Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio Niceno prohibitum fuiſſe neſciebam,</hi> and gives this as the reaſon why he would not ſo ordain <hi>Eradius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next he would prove, that this <hi>proviſion for a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour does not deſtroy that Rule,</hi> by an inſtance, I need not tranſcribe it at large, the ſum of it is this, <hi>when the Government is Monarchical, if it fall out</hi> once (in many Ages, as it did in <hi>England</hi> once in above 500 years) <hi>that another King be crowned, beſides him who hath the Throne; yet it will be true enough, that it is the rule of thoſe Kingdoms to have but one King.</hi> To which I ſay briefly, if it be <hi>uſual</hi> to have two Kings in ſuch a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it will ſcarce be thought true, that it is <hi>the inviolable Rule</hi> of thoſe Kingdoms, to have but one King. And then how this inſtance will ſute his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:95960:18"/> let thoſe judge who take notice, that, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved it <hi>uſual</hi> in the antient Church for Cities in all parts to have <hi>two Biſhops at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From <hi>pag.</hi> 12. he paſſes to <hi>pag.</hi> 23. To ſhew there were more Biſhopricks than one in the Region or Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>Hippo</hi> I brought ſeveral inſtances; and might have produced more, but that I confined my ſelf to thoſe which the learned <hi>Dean</hi> alledged to the contrary. <hi>Fuſſala</hi> is one of them, and tha alone this <hi>Gentleman</hi> takes notice of. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> calls it <hi>Caſtellum</hi> diverſe times in one Epiſtle. He finds fault that I tranſlate <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellum</hi> a <hi>Caſtle.</hi> I did no more expect to be blamed for this, than if I had render'd <hi>Oppidum</hi> a Town. But I ſuppoſe he counts it no great crime, ſince he runs into it himſelf and in a few lines after calls it a <hi>Caſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But theſe Caſtles, ſayes he, were Garriſon Towns, with a good dependance of Villages belonging to them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They were Fortreſſes, and ſometimes had Villages depending on them, and might contain ſo many build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as there are in ſome Village or little Town; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he calls them <hi>Caſtles,</hi> and may give me leave to do ſo too.</p>
            <p>He adds, <q>It was 40 miles diſtant from <hi>Hippo,</hi> and was in St. <hi>Auſtine</hi>'s Dioceſs, and never had a Biſhop of its own.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid indeed to belong to the <hi>Dioceſs of</hi> Hippo, but I do not find it ſaid to be in St. <hi>Auſtine's Dioceſs</hi> or Biſhoprick; theſe are two things and ſhould not be confounded. When it is ſaid to <hi>belong to the Dioceſs of</hi> Hippo, ſo farr diſtant, Dioceſs is not taken as an <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical ſenſe</hi> as it is with us, for part of a Countrey under the Government of <hi>one</hi> Biſhop; but as it was uſed in <hi>Africa</hi> in a <hi>civil</hi> ſenſe, for part of a Province, without reſpect to <hi>one Biſhop,</hi> or to <hi>any one Biſhop</hi> at all. Some
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95960:19"/> parts there call'd Dioceſſes <hi>had no Biſhops, nor were to have any</hi> by Decrees of the <hi>African Councils</hi> 
               <note n="r" place="margin">
                  <hi>Con. Carth.</hi> 2. <hi>Can.</hi> 5. <hi>Code Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fric.</hi> 53.</note>. Other places called a <hi>Dioceſs</hi> had more Biſhops than <hi>one. Petilian</hi> ſayes, that in the place where his Collegue <hi>Januarius</hi> was Biſhop there were 4 Biſhops beſides, all five in <hi>unâ Dioeceſi</hi> 
               <note n="s" place="margin">
                  <hi>Coll. Carth. D.</hi> 1 <hi>Num.</hi> 117.</note>. And thus it was in many other places, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in that called the <hi>Dioceſs of</hi> Hippo, as I ſhew'd by diverſe inſtances, and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s own Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Hereby it appears that in <hi>Africa,</hi> a <hi>Dioceſs</hi> and a <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> were not the ſame thing, though they be with us. There were diverſe Dioceſſes and no Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks and many Biſhopricks where but one Dioceſs; ſo that <hi>Fuſſala</hi> and 20 other Caſtles and Towns might be in the <hi>Dioceſs of</hi> Hippo, <hi>at</hi> 40 <hi>miles diſtance</hi> or more; and yet St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Biſhoprick, not one jot the larger for it, nor he more a Dioceſan.</p>
            <p>Whereas he adds, <hi>that it never had a Biſhop of its own.</hi> It is unqueſtionable that <hi>Fuſſala</hi> had a Biſhop of its own in <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time; and this renders it wholly unſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their purpoſe; for the Biſhoprick of <hi>Hippo,</hi> ſaid to be <hi>of</hi> 40 <hi>miles extent,</hi> will not upon the count of <hi>Fuſſala</hi> be 40 yards larger. Nor will either of theſe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, nor any other in that Region be Dioceſans; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there can be two Dioceſans, and I know not how many more, in <hi>one Dioceſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I aſſigned this reaſon, why <hi>Fuſſala</hi> had not a Biſhop ſooner, becauſe <hi>Auſtin</hi> declares, <hi>there was not one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in it,</hi> and ſuppoſed this might ſerve the turn, not dreaming that thoſe who count all the people in a very large Pariſh, or in an 100 Pariſhes little enough for a Dioceſan; could think his Dioceſs competently furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when he had not <hi>one Soul</hi> (or but ſome few) in communion with him.</p>
            <p>He ſayes, <hi>the Town or Caſtle indeed had none, but the County belonging to it had ſome;</hi> he will have the Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95960:19"/> or Pariſh depending on this <hi>Caſtle</hi> to be a <hi>County.</hi> I cannot but obſerve the admirable power of a fancy tinctured and prepoſſeſſed. It will turn a <hi>Pariſh</hi> into a <hi>County,</hi> and a <hi>Caſtle</hi> into a <hi>County Town;</hi> and ſince a <hi>County</hi> with us, was a <hi>Province</hi> with them, one <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> muſt be as much as all <hi>Africa;</hi> and a very ſmall <hi>part</hi> of <hi>Numidia,</hi> muſt be far greater than the <hi>whole.</hi> But there are ſome <hi>Hypotheſes,</hi> which may ſtand in need of ſuch imaginations.</p>
            <p>However he likes not my reaſon, and why? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, <hi>though it had no Catholicks in it then, it might have ſome before</hi> and concludes it had, <hi>becauſe it belonged here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore to the Dioceſs of Hippo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But that it formerly had Catholicks, (ſaies he) we may conclude by Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s reaſoning, becauſe it belonged heretofore to the Dioceſs of <hi>Hippo.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If <hi>Dioceſs</hi> be taken in a <hi>civil</hi> ſenſe (as it is frequently in <hi>African</hi> Authors) this will be no proof, that <hi>there had been any Catholicks in it,</hi> becauſe in this ſenſe <hi>Fuſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la</hi> might belong to that Dioceſs, though there had not been either Chriſtian or Biſhop in the whole Region: Nor will it be hereby proved, taking it in the Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical ſenſe; for that part of <hi>Hippo,</hi> which was under the <hi>Donatiſt</hi> Biſhop, had no Catholick; and yet <hi>de jure,</hi> as he tells us, belonged to the Dioceſs, (as he calls it,) or charge of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Yet ſince he allows Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s Argument, he muſt admit what it concludes, <hi>viz.</hi> that a place that hath no Chriſtians or Catholicks in it, belongs to no Biſhop; and then <hi>Fuſſala</hi> never belonged to St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> as its Biſhop; either <hi>before</hi> it had Catholicks, for againſt this the Argument is admitted to be concluſive: not <hi>after,</hi> for then it had a Biſhop of its own. And ſo all they have to alledge for the largeneſs of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Biſhoprick comes to nothing.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:95960:20"/>
            <p>
               <q>So that I conceive the reaſon will not hold, for its having no Biſhop of its own, ſince the ſame reaſon deſtroys its dependence upon the the Dioceſs of <hi>Hippo,</hi> which is expreſly affirmed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon I gave for its having no Biſhop, was, becauſe St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> declares <hi>there was no Catholick in it.</hi> This reaſon will <hi>hold,</hi> unleſs they think a place may have a Biſhop where there are no Chriſtians at all; when as yet they judge, that a place which hath Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians enough to make a <hi>good Congregation,</hi> or <hi>many,</hi> ought not to have a Biſhop. Whereas he ſayes this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>deſtroys its dependance upon the Dioceſs,</hi> I wonder what <hi>dependance</hi> he imagines, ſince it is ſuch, as both the <hi>not having</hi> of Chriſtians, and alſo the <hi>having of them,</hi> deſtroys it. The former he here affirms, <hi>the ſame reaſon</hi> (which is its not having of Catholicks) <hi>deſtroys it;</hi> the latter is undeniable, for when <hi>Fuſſala</hi> had a competent number of Catholicks, a Biſhop was there conſtituted; and then it depended no more on the <hi>Dioceſs</hi> of <hi>Hippo,</hi> than one Biſhop's Church depends on another, when both are independent.</p>
            <p>The dependance of <hi>Fuſſala</hi> upon <hi>Hippo</hi> was ſuch, as that of a Countrey place upon a greater Town well furniſhed with Officers for their help, to convert and reduce the Inhabitants, and when enough are convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to help them to a Biſhop or Paſtor. This St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did for <hi>Fuſſala,</hi> he imployed Presbyters to reduce the Donatiſts there, and when they were reduced, he adds them not to his own charge, would not have them <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopo cedere;</hi> but adviſes them to have a Biſhop of their own, and procures one for them. This was the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the primitive times, in theſe methods were Churches and Biſhops multiplyed; it was not out of uſe in the <hi>fifth Age,</hi> this of <hi>Fuſſala</hi> as managed by St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is a remarkable inſtance thereof; and if other Biſhops had
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:95960:20"/> imitated him, as he did the Apoſtles, and beſt Ages, the Church would not have been troubled with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates about <hi>Dioceſans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>Auſtin</hi> would not take the Charge of a Place ſo far off as <hi>Fuſſala,</hi> he will have it <hi>aſcribed to his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>desty.</hi> But it was ſuch <hi>Modesty</hi> as this excellent Perſon made Conſcience of, being convinced <hi>certiſſimâ ratione,</hi> by <hi>moſt certain reaſon,</hi> that he was not ſufficient for it. If all other Biſhops had been ſo <hi>modeſt,</hi> ſo conſcientious, there might have been, as <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaks, when Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops were multiplyed in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a much more deſirable thing, to thoſe that <hi>love Souls,</hi> than a great Dioceſs.</p>
            <p>He gives a reaſon why this muſt be aſcribed to St. <hi>Auſtin's modeſty,</hi> becauſe <hi>he diſcharged the Office of a Biſhop there, in more difficult times, while the Presbyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I need not deny that he performed the <hi>Office of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> there; for it is the office of a Biſhop to endeavour by himſelf or others, the converting or reducing of all that he can. Only this will not prove <hi>Fuſſala</hi> to be then a part of his Biſhoprick, no more than it will prove <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to have been Biſhop of <hi>India;</hi> becauſe he encouraged, and ſent <hi>Frumentius</hi> with others thither, to convert the <hi>Indians</hi>

            <p>The learned <hi>Dean</hi> had cited <hi>Auſtin</hi> as calling himſelf the Biſhop of that <hi>Dioceſs</hi> (underſtanding by it a Region of vaſt extent) I obſerved that in the Epiſtle quoted he onely ſaith he had the <hi>Epiſcopal charge of</hi> Hippo. By this the Gentleman changing my words, will have me to ſignifie, that he was the Biſhop of the <hi>Town only.</hi> This I did not intend, but that, he was not <hi>the only Biſhop</hi> of that whole Region. But whether he was Biſhop of part of the Town only, or of that and ſome part of the Region alſo, I am not much concerned. His words are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:95960:21"/>
               <q>as if he had been Biſhop of the Town only, nay, but of part of that neither, for the <hi>Donatists</hi> had their Biſhop there: ſo this will ſtrangely diminiſh the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoprick of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> which at firſt appeared ſo large.</q> Then he anſwers, for <hi>the Donatiſts having a Biſhop there, it ſignifies little to our preſent purpoſe, ſince he was but an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this ſignifies as much to my purpoſe as I need; for the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> having a Biſhoprick in <hi>Hippo,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> muſt needs be diminiſhed thereby, and altogether as much leſſened, as if they had not been <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers.</hi> And they were counted no otherwiſe <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpers,</hi> but ſo that if the <hi>Donatist</hi> Biſhop had been reconciled; by a Decree of the <hi>African</hi> Church he was to continue in his Biſhop-there, as a <hi>rightful Poſſeſſour,</hi> and there would have been ſtill two Dioceſſes (ſuch as they were) in one Town.</p>
            <p>He would have us <hi>believe Auſtin</hi> as if he declared, that he was not the Biſhop of the Town only; but his words are, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t modum diſpenſationis meae non ſupergrediar hoc Eccleſiae ad Hipponenſem Regionem pertinenti prodeſſe conteſtor,</hi> which, ſayes our Author, plainly ſignifies, <hi>that all the Church belonging, not only to the Town, but but alſo to the Region of</hi> Hippo, <hi>belonged to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if he pleaſe to view the words again which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf hath quoted, he will find it plainly ſignifyed, that Auſtin's <hi>Church belonged to the Region of</hi> Hippo, <hi>but not that all the Church both in Town and Region, belonged to him. Antonius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Fuſſala</hi> might have ſaid this as truly of his Church there, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> did it of his Church at <hi>Hippo;</hi> it did <hi>ad Hipponenſem Regionem pertinere,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Region of <hi>Hippo.</hi> And it may be as juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from hence, that all the Church both in the Town and Region of <hi>Hippo</hi> belonged to the Biſhop of <hi>Fuſſala.</hi> If our Author will allow of this (as he muſt if he will
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95960:21"/> ſtand to his own account of this paſſage) <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick will be <hi>ſtrangely diminiſhed</hi> indeed, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a part of <hi>Hippo</hi> and made leſs than I repreſent it. For I did not ſay, nor had I any need to aſſert, that he was Biſhop of the Town only. We may allow him beſides his part of the Town, diverſe Villages in the Countrey (though I have not ſeen it proved) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any danger of aſſigning him a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church. For <hi>Kidderminſter</hi> (as one tells us, who very well knows it) hath 20 Villages belonging to it, and ſome thouſands of Souls therein, yet according to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern meaſures will ſcarce make a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church <note n="u" place="margin">M. <hi>B. of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy, Part</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note>.</p>
            <p>To ſhew that there were <hi>more Biſhops in the Region of</hi> Hippo, than St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> beſides particular inſtances (which he paſſes by) I alledged a paſſage of his where the <hi>Donatists</hi> were deſired to <hi>meet together with the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Biſhops, that were in that Region, and who there ſuffered ſo much by the Donatists:</hi> to this he anſwers, <q>That theſe Biſhops who are ſaid to be in <hi>Regione Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponenſi,</hi> were not the Biſhops of that <hi>Region,</hi> but ſome Biſhops of the <hi>Province</hi> met together there.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But that theſe were Biſhops of the <hi>Province</hi> met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether there, is a meer conjecture of his own, without the leaſt ground either in this paſſage or any other in that <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> It will not be hard to anſwer any thing at this rate. If there had been a <hi>Provincial</hi> Council then held in that <hi>Region,</hi> there might have been ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for what he ſayes; but there is not any hint of this in the whole <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> That which is deſired is a <hi>Meeting for conference, Hoc eſt ergo deſiderium noſtrum, &amp;c. Primum ſi fieri poteſt ut cum Epiſcopis noſtris pacificè conferatis—, ideo nos conferre volumus—,</hi> and the prime occaſion of it was the outrages committed in that Region by the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> wherein the Biſhops of that place were particularly concerned. This is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95960:22"/> as in other parts of the Epiſtle, ſo particularly in the <hi>paſſage cited, Epiſcopos noſtros qui ſunt in Regione Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponenſi, ubi tanta mala patimur.</hi> This Meeting was to be with the <hi>Catholick</hi> Biſhops upon the place, in <hi>Regione Hipponenſi,</hi> not any to be call'd from other parts. And theſe words ſeem brought in to prevent an objection which the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> might make againſt a more general, or more publick meeting, as that which might bring them in danger of the Laws in force againſt them; <hi>An fortè iſtae leges Imperatoris vos non permittunt noſtros Epiſcopos conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nire,</hi> and then immediately follows theſe words in anſwer to it, <hi>Ecce interim Epiſcopos noſtros qui ſunt in Regione Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponenſi,</hi> &amp;c. ſo that this to me ſeems the plain ſence of both Objection and anſwer; If becauſe of the Laws you dare not meet us in a more General or Provincial Council, yet give a Meeting to the Biſhops of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Region, where there can be no apprehenſion of danger. All which makes me judge, what he ſayes concerning the <hi>Biſhops of the Province</hi> as here intended, to be no better than an Evaſion.</p>
            <p>To prove that there was but one Biſhop in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of <hi>Hippo,</hi> he tells us, <q>That the Clergy there cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in the Inſcription of an Epiſtle, <hi>Clerici Regionis Hipponenſium,</hi> ſpeaking of the Biſhop of <hi>Hippo,</hi> do call him their Biſhop, and not one of their Biſhops, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But the Clergy ſo called, may be only the Clergy of <hi>Hippo,</hi> and ſo they are in the Title of the Epiſtle <hi>Clerici Hippone Catholici:</hi> and well may they of <hi>Hippo</hi> be called the Clergy of the <hi>Region,</hi> both becauſe they were in that Region, and were the Clergy of it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. But if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſhould be extended to <hi>more</hi> or to <hi>all</hi> in the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their calling him <hi>Epiſcopus noſter,</hi> will be no proof that they had no other Biſhop, but him at <hi>Hippo.</hi> For that
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95960:22"/> phraſe <hi>Epiſcopus noster</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopi noſtri,</hi> all along in this Epiſtle, doth not denote the Biſhop of that <hi>particular Church</hi> to which they belonged (as he would have it) but a Biſhop of their <hi>party</hi> or <hi>perſwaſion.</hi> So they call <hi>Valentinus noſtrum Catholicum Epiſcopum,</hi> who yet was not Biſhop of <hi>Hippo.</hi> So they call them <hi>Epiſcopos noſtros,</hi> whom they deſired the Donatiſts to meet once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain <note n="w" place="margin">

            <p>Beſides <hi>Iſchyras,</hi> I had mentioned <hi>Dracontius,</hi> both Biſhops in the <hi>Territory</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> (as <hi>Agathammon</hi> alſo was <note n="z" place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>But a Chorepiſcopus is elſewhere with him a <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan a,</hi> and here he ſayes that he did <hi>accept</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 590.</note> 
               <hi>Biſhoprick.</hi> Now theſe put together will go near to make a <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan</hi> Biſhop. But then if there were two or three Biſhops in the Dioceſs of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> beſides <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> they will ſcarce be ſo much as half <hi>Dioceſans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſayes <hi>Athanaſius preſſ'd him to accept it.</hi> If ſo this great Perſon was no more unwilling to have another Biſhop in his <hi>Dioceſs,</hi> and in a <hi>Countrey place</hi> too, than <hi>Austin</hi> was to have one at <hi>Fuſſala,</hi> He ſayes further this was an <hi>extraordinary caſe,</hi> though what was <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> in it I cannot imagine; to prove any thing there mentioned to be ſo, will be an hard task.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And allowing this man a Countrey Biſhoprick, that of <hi>Alexandria</hi> would be a great deal too bigg for the Congregational meaſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo it might be, and yet be no <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Church; if that will ſatisfie him which is <hi>too big for thoſe meaſures,</hi> he ſeems content to drop his cauſe, and may leave it in the hands of <hi>Presbyterians.</hi> And he is in the more danger, becauſe he ſeems not apprehenſive of it, but counts it enough if he thinks a Church is any where found larger than <hi>one</hi> Congregation.</p>
            <p>I had given inſtances of ſeveral Towns that had Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, and were but two or three or four <hi>&amp;c.</hi> miles diſtant one from another this he denies not: but asks <hi>what does this conclude? might not thoſe Dioceſſes be yet much larger than one Congregation?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="37" facs="tcp:95960:23"/>
            <p> I might conclude that theſe were juſt ſuch <hi>Dioceſſes</hi> as our Countrey Pariſhes are; and had ſuch Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as thoſe Pariſh Churches have. And ſome of them in time might have proviſion (as ſome of ours have) for more Congregations than one. And if our <hi>modern Dioceſſes</hi> were of this proportion, they would be much more conformable to the <hi>antient</hi> Modells.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Suppoſe the chief Congregations of <hi>Holland</hi> had each a Biſhop, yet I conceive they would be Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans, though thoſe Cities lie very cloſe together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He might have laid the <hi>ſcene</hi> at home, where we are better acquainted, and ſuppoſed this of our Countrey Towns; or of both the <hi>chief,</hi> and <hi>leſſer</hi> Towns in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> if he had deſigned what would be moſt parallel. But to take it as it is formed, though thoſe Cities lay not further diſtant, and had each of them a Biſhop, yet if their Churches were governed in common by Biſhop and Presbyters, as the antient Churches were; they would not be <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> but more like the Model of the Churches and Government which <hi>Holland</hi> hath at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And now after all this, though we have ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> how near Cities were together in ſome parts; yet upon the whole account the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes do appear to be large enough, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He would have us think where Cities are <hi>ſo near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (as I had ſhewed) yet becauſe of <hi>their number</hi> the Dioceſſes might be large enough. But where they were ſo near together, they could not be large enough to make any thing like the modern Dioceſſes, no, nor larger than our Countrey Pariſhes if they had Biſhops in them.

No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this hindered any City from having a Biſhop in the four firſt Ages; though the greateſt part of their Cities (as may be made manifeſt) were no greater than our Market-Towns or fairer Villages.

            <p>
               <q>For in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his time there were not an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Biſhops in all <hi>Egypt, Lybia</hi> and <hi>Pentapolis</hi>

            <p>I was a little ſurprized to read this, and ſee <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius</hi> cited for it.

            <p>I am made more confident by all that is ſaid to the contrary, that the evidence is really ſuch, as will need no favour, if it can meet with Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Now ſuppoſe that all the Chriſtians in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> the Catholicks at leaſtwiſe, could meet together in that great Church, yet all the Dioceſs could not.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All that was undertaken to be proved by the paſſage in queſtion, was, that the <hi>main body of Christians in</hi> Alexandria adhereing to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> could, and did meet in that one Church. If this be granted nothing is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that he intended to prove. As for a <hi>Dioceſs</hi> in the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:95960:25"/> Countrey, if he will ſhew us what, or where it was, and that it <hi>had no other Biſhop in it,</hi> he will do ſomething that may be conſidered; yet nothing at all againſt what this Teſtimony was made uſe of to evince.</p>
            <p>He ſayes 2dly, <q>Suppoſe this great great Church could receive all the multitude, yet if that multitude was too great for Perſonal Communion it is inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> it might be too great for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary meeting in the Congregational way, yet not big enough for a Dioceſan Church. But the <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> is groundleſs and contradicts <hi>Athanaſius</hi> who ſayes they had Perſonal Communion, <hi>they all prayed together,</hi> and did not only meet within the Walls, but <hi>concurred in the worſhip, and ſaid, Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſayes 3dly, <q>Before the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> met in diſtinct Congregations, but we are told that <hi>thoſe places were very ſmall, ſhort and ſtrait places.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe <hi>ſave one,</hi> I ſaid, which he ought not to have omitted. And they were ſo <hi>ſmall,</hi> becauſe thoſe who were wont to meet in them ſeverally, ſo as to fill them, could all meet in one Church, and did ſo as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> declares.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But that they were ſuch Chappels or Churches, as ſome of our Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> have as great a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber as <hi>Alexandria,</hi> is hardly credible.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I know not how thoſe places could be well expreſſed with more diminution than <hi>Athanaſius</hi> hath done it, he ſayes they were not only <hi>ſtrait</hi> and <hi>ſmall,</hi> but the very <hi>ſmallest.</hi> If he will make it appear that our Churches or Chappels are leſs than thoſe that were <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, I ſhall underſtand that which I could never before, that ſomething is <hi>leſs</hi> than that which is <hi>least of all.</hi> But he will prove they were not ſo <hi>ſmall,</hi> becauſe firſt <hi>the Church of</hi> Alexandria <hi>was very numerous from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:95960:25"/> Why it ſhould be counted ſo very <hi>numerous from the beginning,</hi> I know no reaſon, but the miſtake of an <hi>Hiſtorian</hi> who will have a <hi>Sect</hi> of the <hi>Jews</hi> (which was numerous in or about <hi>Alexandria)</hi> to be Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And if they met all in one place it muſt conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be very large.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The ground of the conſequence is removed, <hi>Valeſius</hi> his own Author ſayes they had <hi>but one Church to meet in, in</hi> Dionyſius <hi>his time,</hi> almoſt 3 Ages from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 64</note>. If that one was large, yet it is not like that it ſtood till <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his time; after ſo many <hi>Edicts</hi> for demoliſhing of all Chriſtian Churches, and a ſevere Execution of them in <hi>Diocletian</hi>'s Perſecution.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Nor is it likely they ſhould divide till they were grown too numerous for the biggeſt Meeting-place they could conveniently have.</q>

            <p>It is as <hi>likely</hi> as that <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſpeaks truth, in a matter which he perfectly knew; he tells us they did <hi>divide,</hi> and yet were not too numerous for <hi>one great Church,</hi> in which they met conveniently too; yea, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than when diſperſed in thoſe little places, as he ſayes and proves, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>2dly, He ſayes, <q>Though before the <hi>Empire</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted they might be confined to little places, and forced to meet ſeverally; yet after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> became Chriſtian, it is not likely that the <hi>Alexandrians</hi> would content themſelves with <hi>ſmall</hi> and <hi>ſtrait</hi> Chappels.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor did they content themſelves with thoſe little ones, for beſides this built in <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his time, there was one greater than thoſe ſmall ones finiſhed in <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi>'s time, where the body of Catholicks aſſembled with <hi>Alexander,</hi> the other places being too ſtrait, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:95960:26"/> very ſmall which <hi>Athanaſius</hi> repreſents as ſuch, becauſe there was one (expreſly excepted from that number) ſomething larger? As for what he adds, that <hi>then every ordinary City, built very great and magnificent Cathedrals,</hi> it is eaſily ſaid, but will never be proved.</p>
            <p>
               <q>3dly, Some of theſe Churches had been built with a deſign of receiving as many as well could have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Communion in Worſhip together.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Neither will this hold, unleſs ſome of thoſe Churches could have received <hi>all,</hi> which had <hi>Perſonal Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> with <hi>Athanaſius</hi> in this greateſt Church; which he denies, and makes uſe of to <hi>Conſtantius</hi> as a plea why he made uſe of the <hi>greateſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As <hi>Theonas</hi> is ſaid by <hi>Athanaſius</hi> to have built a Church bigger than any of thoſe they had before.</q>

            </p>
            <p>That <hi>all</hi> and <hi>every one</hi> did come, was never imagined. It is but the <hi>main body</hi> of the Catholicks that M. <hi>B.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends, as our <hi>Author</hi> obſerves a little before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>For the <hi>tumultuous manner</hi> in which they came to their Biſhop to demand a general Aſſembly, makes it probable that not only Women and Children, would be glad to abſent themſelves, but <hi>many more,</hi> either apprehenſive of the effect of this <hi>tumultuous proceeding,</hi> or of the danger of ſuch a crowd.</q>

            <p>The Women he will not admit; but was it ever known that ſuch a great and ſolemn Aſſembly for Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip conſiſted only of Men?

Are not the Women in the <hi>Primitive</hi> Church often noted for ſuch Zeal for the Worſhip of Chriſt, as made them contemn far greater dangers, than here they had any cauſe to be apprehenſive of? The ſuppoſed <hi>danger</hi> was either from the <hi>Crowd</hi> or the <hi>Tumult.</hi> For the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, did <hi>the Women</hi> and <hi>many more</hi> never come to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Aſſemblies, when there was any danger of being <hi>crowded?</hi> I think there was as great danger from a <hi>crowd</hi> in <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> his Reign, when the <hi>whole City</hi> of <hi>C.

And yet, how it comes to paſs I know not, it is quite out of his thoughts while he is examining it. He was ſo haſty for confuting, that he ſtaies not to take notice what he was to confute, though the intent of it be moſt plain and obvious, both by the <hi>occaſion</hi> and <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Letter:</hi> But Forces that ſenſe on it, and makes that the deſign of it; which I was far from thinking, would ever come into any man's Fancy, when he was awake. The words of the Letter are theſe; <hi>The City of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>ſayes</hi> Strabo, <hi>is like a Soldiers Cloak,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and by computation about ten miles in compaſs, a</hi> 3<hi>d. or 4th. part of this was taken up with</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:95960:28"/> 
               <hi>publick buildings, Temples and Royal Palaces; thus is two miles and an half or three and a quarter taken up.</hi> He anſwers, <q>I will not ſay this <hi>learned friend</hi> hath impoſed on M. <hi>B.</hi> but there is a very great miſtake betwixt them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the miſtake is his own, and ſuch a one, as I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he could fall into it. He takes it for granted, that the Argument is brought to prove what Chriſtians <hi>Alexandria</hi> had in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time. Here is not the leaſt occaſion given for this, unleſs the citing of <hi>Strabo</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dimenſions of that City: but <hi>Primate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> is quoted too, on the ſame account; and ſo as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to fancy the deſign was to ſhew what Chriſtians <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria</hi> had in the <hi>Primate's time. Jcrome, Epipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, Theodoret, Socrates, Sozomen</hi> are alſo cited there; why could not theſe as well lead him to the right Age, which their words plainly point at, without the leaſt glance at any Age before, as <hi>Strabo</hi> alone (cited with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any reſpect to the time when he writ) ſo far miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead him? Nay, the 4th. age is expreſly mentioned in the Letter; and the numerouſneſs of the <hi>Novatians</hi> and <hi>Arians</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> at the time intended, is inſiſted on; could he think any man ſo ſtupid, that had but the leaſt acquaintance with thoſe things, as to ſpeak of <hi>Arians,</hi> and <hi>Novatians</hi> in <hi>Strabo</hi>'s time? But it may be, though I would hope better, our <hi>Examiner</hi> was too inclinable to fix an abſurd thing upon the <hi>Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of the <hi>Letter;</hi> that he might be excuſed, from giving a better anſwer when it was not ready.</p>
            <p>But let us hear what he ſayes to it; yet what can be expected to be ſaid by one who makes his own dream the Foundation of his Diſcourſe? However let us try if we can find any one clauſe that is <hi>true and pertinent</hi> in the whole, and begin with the beſt of it.</p>
            <p>Though <hi>Strabo</hi> ſayes that Temples and great Palaces took up a 4th. or a 3d. of the City, yet our <hi>Examiner</hi>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:95960:28"/> will have us think there might be inhabitants there; when <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſayes, as I cited him, that part was <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, deſtitute of Inhabitants, ſo he tells us <hi>Bruchium</hi> was. The Examiner denies not <hi>Bruchium</hi> to be that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the City which <hi>Strabo</hi> ſayes, <hi>was taken up with Publick Buildings,</hi> but adds, <hi>what all the publick build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Town in one Region?</hi> But who ſaid <hi>all</hi> the Publick Buildings? This is his own fancy ſtill.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And that an outer skirt too, as it is deſcribed by the Greek <hi>Martyrology</hi> in <hi>Hillarion,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If he mean it was not a Part or Region of the City <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Epiphanius</hi> will have Credit before a <hi>story</hi> out of the Greek <hi>Martyrology,</hi> or him that tells it, when it appears not in the words cited. In <hi>Strabo</hi> it is <gap reason="foreign">

               <hi>C. P.</hi> in imitation of it, ſo <hi>Alexandria</hi> was divided into 5, whereof <hi>Bruchium</hi> was one, and the greateſt of all.

            <p>
               <q>This <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſayes was deſtitute of Inhabitants in his time, and not unlikely, and perhaps deſtitute of Publick Buildings too, for it was <hi>deſtroyed</hi> after an obſtinate ſiege in the Reign of <hi>Aurelian</hi> as <hi>Ammianus Marcellinus,</hi> or of <hi>Claudius</hi> as <hi>Euſebius.</hi>

            <p>But all this which he ſayes, if there were <hi>truth</hi> in it, is impertinent; for the <hi>Letter</hi> is not concerned what <hi>Jews</hi> were there near <hi>Strabo</hi> or <hi>Adrian</hi>'s time, but in

            <p>Thus he begins, <hi>by the ſame rule he might have diſpoſed of all at once, and concluded out of</hi> Strabo<hi>'s diviſion of the Town, that there was not one Chriſtian in it:</hi> and repeats it thrice in the ſame Page, <hi>No matter what number of</hi> Jews <hi>or Heathens it had in</hi> Strabo<hi>'s dayes—, it is kindly done to provide for Chriſtians before they were in being, ſurely</hi> Strabo, <hi>who makes the diſtribution, never intended the Chriſtians one foot of ground in all that diviſion, and this learned Friend might have ſpared his little Town of</hi> 8 <hi>or</hi> 10 <hi>Furlongs, which he ſo liberally beſtows upon the Biſhop of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>before our Saviour was born—,</hi> and he is at it again ſeveral times in the following diſcourſe <note n="t" place="margin">

            <p>How deſirable a thing is it to have M. <hi>B.</hi> and <hi>his Friend</hi> render'd ridiculous? when rather than it ſhall not be done, our <hi>Examiner</hi> will publiſh his own indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion ſo many times over to effect it.

            <p>Next he would diſprove M. <hi>B</hi>'s repreſentation of the Church of <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Constantius</hi>'s time, by giving a view of that Churches greatneſs from the firſt Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it <note n="u" place="margin">

            <p>
               <q>In St. <hi>Mark's</hi> time <hi>Alexandria</hi> had ſeveral Churches, though but one Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c</hi>

            </p>
            <p>What <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſayes of Churches in <hi>Alexandria</hi> at that time, is grounded upon a miſtake, as appears, becauſe immediately after the words cited, he adds, <hi>ſo great was the multitude of Beleivers at</hi> Mark's <hi>firſt attempt there, that</hi> Philo <hi>in his writings thought fit to give an account of them,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. <hi>Euſebius</hi> conceived that the <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> as <hi>Scaliger,</hi> or the <hi>Therapeutae,</hi> as <hi>Valeſius,</hi> whom <hi>Philo</hi> deſcribes, were the Chriſtians of <hi>Mark</hi>'s Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and there being Aſſemblies of that Sect of the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Philo</hi>'s time, the Hiſtorian ſpeaks of Chriſtian Churches at <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Mark's</hi> time; but thoſe who believe that he erred in the former, can have no reaſon to give him credit in the latter. Our <hi>Examiner</hi> does not deny that he was miſtaken, but ſayes, <hi>it is not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial whether they were Jews or Chriſtians;</hi> yet thoſe who inquire after Truth ſincerely, will think it <hi>material;</hi> and little value a Teſtimony which hath no better ground than a miſtake.</p>
            <p>The next is no better <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 62.</note>, that is an Epiſtle of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian,</hi> which others are puzzled to make ſenſe of, or ſuch ſenſe as can have any appearance of Truth. That very paſſage in it, which is the only ground of our <hi>Author's</hi> Argument, himſelf acknowledges to be falſe; for he would ſhew the Chriſtians in <hi>Alexandria</hi> to be numerous enough for his purpoſe, becauſe it is there ſaid that <hi>ſome</hi> (whom he takes to be Chriſtians) did <hi>force the Patriarch</hi> (whoever he be) <hi>to worſhip Chriſt,</hi> and yet adds, <hi>there is no doubt but Adrian does the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians wrong in this point, for they never forced any to their</hi>

               <hi>Religion.</hi> Will he have us to rely upon reaſonings, which have no better Foundation, than what is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly falſe</hi> by his own Confeſſion?

For if this Patriarch was the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> that they <hi>forced</hi> him to worſhip Chriſt, is <hi>not true,</hi> he did it of his own accord: and if it be not one, who was no Chriſtian, that they forced; then is not any thing in this paſſage to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and <hi>Adrian</hi>'s Epiſtle might have been waved as a meer impertinency.</p>
            <p>That which follows <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 63.</note>, hath not the ſhew of a reaſon, the great Catechiſts of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> as <hi>Pantenus, Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, Origen</hi> and <hi>Heracles,</hi> did not a little advance the growth of Chriſtian Religion in that place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Muſt there needs be a <hi>Dioceſan Church</hi> there becauſe the <hi>Catechiſts</hi> did advance Religion not a little?</p>
            <p>The next concerning <hi>Dionyſius</hi> his Church meeting at <hi>Chebron (Cephro</hi> it ſhould be) and <hi>Coluthio,</hi> is already fully anſwered, as it is offered with better improvement than our <hi>Examiner</hi> gives it <note n="g" place="margin">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:95960:32"/> from this very place to our <hi>Examiners</hi> regret, <hi>Ex hoc loco colligitur, aetate quidem Dionyſii, unicam adhuc fuiſſe Alexandriae Eccleſiam, in quam omnes <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbis illius fideles, Orationis causâ, conveniebant</hi>

            <p>In the next Paragraph our <hi>Examiner</hi> argues for the great numbers of Chriſtians at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from the multitude of Martyrs at <hi>Thebes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Under the Perſecution of <hi>Diocletian</hi> what numbers of Chriſtians might be at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> may be judged by the multitude of Martyrs that ſuffered at <hi>Thebes</hi> 
                  <note n="i" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 64.</note>, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But here he miſtakes <hi>Euſebius,</hi> who gives an account not of the Martyrs which were <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the <hi>City Thebes,</hi> but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the <hi>Province Thebais:</hi> which was half of that large Kingdom, according to the antient diviſion of it into the <hi>upper</hi> and <hi>lower Egypt.</hi> The <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Egypt</hi> was <hi>Thebais,</hi> the <hi>inferiour</hi> was called ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the <hi>Delta,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Egypt</hi> in a reſtrained ſenſe, and this diviſion in theſe terms we have in <hi>Euſebius</hi> (to go no further) a little before <note n="k" place="margin">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, where he begins his account of the Martyrs in this Countrey. Now if the Chriſtians in that Provice of large extent, and compriſing very many Cities may be concluded to be very numerous from the multitudes of Martyrs which ſuffered there; yet nothing at all can be inferred for any numbers to his purpoſe in the City <hi>Thebes,</hi> by which he would conclude their numerouſneſs in <hi>Alexandria.</hi> But if M. <hi>B.</hi> had miſtaken one City for ſo large a Countrey with multitudes of Cities in it, and made that miſtake the ground of his reaſoning; it is like our <hi>Examiner</hi> would have expoſed him for it in his <hi>Preface,</hi> as he does for ſome leſſer matters.</p>
            <p>In the following Paragraph <note n="l" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 65.</note>, there is a groundleſs ſuppoſition, that the diviſion of <hi>Alexandria into Pariſhes was antienter than Arius,</hi> there being no mention of it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:95960:32"/> by any antient Author: as alſo an accuſation of <hi>Peta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius</hi> as miſtaking <hi>Epiphanius</hi> his words, without any <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Serm. of Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion p.</hi> 28.</note> cauſe that I can diſcern in thoſe words, though he ſayes, <hi>it is plain</hi> there. That which he ſayes is plain, the learned Dean of <hi>Paul's</hi> could not diſcern, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>Epiphanius</hi> as <hi>Petavius</hi> and others did before him. Theſe I took to be preliminaries and expected his Argument, but found it not, unleſs it be couched in the firſt words.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The Diviſion of <hi>Alexandria</hi> between ſeveral Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as it were into ſo many Pariſhes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But this ſignifies nothing for his purpoſe, if thoſe in <hi>Alexandria</hi> thus divided could all meet in one place, as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> declares they did; and that ſo plainly that any one will judge ſo, whoſe intereſt is not too hard for his judgment. <hi>Valeſius</hi> (who had no byaſs unleſs what might lead him the other way) underſtood it as I do; and expreſſes it in theſe words. (deciding the matter ſo long inſiſted on, againſt our Author) <hi>After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the times of</hi> Athanaſius, <hi>when there were more Churches built by diverſe Biſhops of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens aſſembled in ſeveral Churches ſeverally and in parcels, as</hi> Athanaſius <hi>ſayes in his Apology to</hi> Conſtantius; <hi>but on the great Feſtivals, Eaſter and Pentecoſt, no particular aſſemblies were held,</hi> ſed univerſi in majorem Eccleſiam conveniebant, ut ibidem teſtatur Athanaſius, <hi>but all of them aſſembled together in the great Church as</hi> Athanaſius <hi>teſtifies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that there can be no pretence that the Church in <hi>Alexandria</hi> was <hi>Dioceſan</hi> at this time, unleſs thoſe who could meet together in one place might make ſuch a Church. Yet this was then the greateſt Church in the <hi>Empire</hi> ſave that at <hi>Rome,</hi> and what he adds makes that at <hi>Rome</hi> very unlike ſuch <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Churches, as are now aſſerted.</p>
            <pb n="56" facs="tcp:95960:33"/>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>Valeſius</hi> inferrs from the ſame paſſage of Pope <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent's</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Decentius,</hi> which <hi>Petavius</hi> brings to prove the contrary, that though there were ſeveral <hi>Titles</hi> or Churches in <hi>Rome</hi> then, and had been long before, yet none of them was as yet appropriated to any Presbyter, but they were ſerved in common as great Cities in <hi>Holland</hi> and ſome other reformed Countreys, that have ſeveral Churches and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The Advocates for <hi>theſe</hi> Churches, who aſſign the bounds of a <hi>Dioceſs</hi> with moſt Moderation, will have it to comprize a City with a <hi>Territory</hi> belonging to it; but there was no Church in the Territory which belonged to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> he had none but within the City, as <hi>Innocentius</hi> declares in the cited Epiſtle, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as now the greateſt City with a Territory larger than ſome antient <hi>Province</hi> is counted little enough for a <hi>Dioceſs.</hi> Further it is now judged to be no Dioceſs which compriſes not very many Churches with Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters appropriated to them; but he tells us none of the Churches in <hi>Rome</hi> were appropriated to any Presbyter, but they were <hi>ſerved in common.</hi> How? as greater Cities in <hi>Holland</hi> and ſome other reformed Countreys, and then they were ruled <hi>in common</hi> as theſe Cities are. The Government of many Churches is not there, nor was of old, ever entruſted in one hand; and thus the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> was no more a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> than the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that City.</p>
            <p>He concludes <note n="m" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 66.</note> with two Aſſertions which will neither of them hold good. The firſt <hi>that it is evident out of</hi> Athanaſius <hi>how the Biſhop of that City had from the beginning ſeveral fixed Congregations under him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is ſo far from being <hi>evident</hi> in <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that he hath not one word which ſo much as intimates that the Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria from the beginning</hi> had any ſuch Congregations under him.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:95960:33"/>
            <p> The other is <hi>that thoſe of Mareotes muſt be ſuppoſed to receive the faith almost as early as</hi> Alexandria.</p>
            <p>How true this is we may underſtand by <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> towards the latter end of the third Age, who declares that then <hi>Mareotes</hi> was <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>So far the Writer of the Letter. Let me now return to our <hi>Author's Preface;</hi> To ſhew that the Chriſtians
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:95960:34"/> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> adhereing to <hi>Athanaſius</hi> were not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding numerous as is pretended, and not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the Chriſtians now in <hi>London,</hi> I had ſaid, <hi>that the greateſt part of the Inhabitants of that City were at this time Heathens or</hi> Jews; <hi>of thoſe who paſſed for Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, it is like</hi> Athanaſius <hi>had the leſſer ſhare</hi>

If in this deſigned work he ſatisfies me, that it was not the <hi>general practice of the antient Church, for the People to concur in the choice of their Biſhops,</hi> he will do me a greater diſpleaſure, than the confutation of what I have writ, or any other that I can fear he intends me; by taking me off from further Converſation with <hi>antient Authors,</hi> as perſons by whoſe Writings we can <hi>clearly</hi> know nothing. For if <hi>that point</hi> be not <hi>clear</hi> in Antiquity. I can never expect to find any thing there that is ſo.</p>
            <p>I intended to conclude this diſcourſe here, without giving the Reader further trouble; but conſidering there are miſapprehenſions about the Subject in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:95960:35"/> thoſe being taken by diverſe, for <hi>Dioceſan Churches</hi> which indeed are not ſuch, and arguments uſed to prove them ſo which are not competent for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, (of which there are many inſtances, as elſewhere ſo particularly in the latter end of this Authors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe): I thought it requiſite for the rectifying of theſe miſtakes, and to ſhew the inſufficiency or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency of ſuch reaſonings, to give an account what <hi>mediums</hi> cannot in reaſon be eſteemed, to afford com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent proof of <hi>Dioceſan Churches.</hi>

            <p>In general, Thoſe who will ſatisfy us that any Churches, in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, were <hi>Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan,</hi> ſhould prove them to be ſuch <hi>Dioceſans</hi> as ours are, as large or near as large; otherwiſe what they offer, will ſcarce appear to be pertinent. For the riſe of this debate is the queſtion between us, whether the Biſhops of theſe times be ſuch as thoſe in the <hi>primitive</hi> Church. This we deny, becauſe modern Biſhops will have <hi>another ſort of Churches</hi> or Dioceſes, than were known in the beſt Ages.

The modern <hi>Dioceſes,</hi> and Churches thence denominated are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and extenſive, conſiſting of many ſcores, or many hundred particular Churches, whereas for the three firſt Ages we cannot find 3 Biſhops that had <hi>two</hi> particular Churches in his Dioceſs, nor in the 4th. one in 50 (if I may not ſay one in a hundred) that had <hi>more.</hi> So that the difference is exceeding great, and more conſiderable in the <hi>conſequence</hi> thereof, which I had rather give an account of in the words of the very learned D. <hi>St.</hi> than mine own. <hi>Dioceſes generally,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>in the primitive, and Eaſtern Churches were very ſmall</hi>

            <p>The Author of the Vindication will not have ſo great a part of thoſe <hi>Converts</hi> to be <hi>Strangers,</hi> and to return home when the Feaſt was over, and aſſigns ſomething like reaſons for it.</p>

            <p>He would not have us ſuſpect that the numbers of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were not ſo great as he pretends, becauſe <hi>Pella,</hi> an obſcure little Town, could receive them all beſides its own Inhabitants, <q>but we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that Town to be their <hi>Metropolis,</hi> and the Believers all ſcattered through the whole Countrey, and this as <hi>Epiphanius</hi> writes.</q>

            <p>Our Author adds one Teſtimony more, to ſhew that under the Government of <hi>Simeon</hi> great numbers were <q>added to that Church, many thouſands of the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion receiving the Chriſtian Faith at that time, and among the reſt <hi>Juſtus, &amp;c. pag.</hi> 448.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But thoſe who view the place in <hi>Euſebius</hi> will ſee, that he does not ſay thoſe many of the Circumciſion were converted by <hi>Simeon,</hi> or were <hi>under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or belonged to that Church; and ſo it ſignifies nothing for his purpoſe. And ſo in fine, the account wherewith he concludes his Diſcourſe of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> will not be admitted by any who impartially conſider the Premiſſes.</p>
            <p>As for his other Scripture inſtances, there is not ſo much as the ſhadow of a proof ſhewed by him, that there were near ſo many Chriſtians as in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> or as are in ſome one of our Pariſhes, yea, or more than could meet in one place, either in <hi>Samaria</hi> (where he ſayes it <hi>appears not what kind of Government was establiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, pag.</hi> 451.) or in <hi>Lydda,</hi> which was but a Village, though a fair one, and far from having <hi>Saron</hi> for its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Territory, that being a plain between <hi>Joppa</hi> and <hi>Caeſarea;</hi> or in <hi>Antioch, pag.</hi> 452. much leſs in <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Epheſus</hi> which he adviſedly paſſes by, <hi>pag.</hi> 456.</p>
            <pb n="76" facs="tcp:95960:43"/>
            <p> Our Author does in effect acknowledge that in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it appears not that theſe Churches were <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> much leſs <hi>Dioceſan;</hi> 
               <q>It is to be confeſſed, ſaies he, <hi>pag.</hi> 461. that the Scriptures have not left ſo full and perfect an account of the Conſtitution and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>firſt</hi> Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus we have no more notice of the Churches of <hi>Samaria</hi> and of <hi>Judaea (Jeruſalem</hi> excepted) than that ſuch were founded by the Apoſtles; but of their <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> we have not the leaſt Information. What <hi>information</hi>
               </q> then can we have that they were <hi>Dioceſan</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopal?</hi> He goes on, <q>And the proſpect left of <hi>Antioch</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is very confuſed, as of a Church in <hi>fieri,</hi> where a great number of eminent perſons laboured together to the building of it up; but only from <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Writers, who report that this Church, when it was ſettled and digeſted, was committed to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Euodias,</hi> and after him to <hi>Ignatius, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q> So that after what form the Church at <hi>Antioch</hi> was conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted does not appear (it may be Congregational and not Dioceſan, for any thing this Gentleman can ſee in Scripture) but only from Eccleſiaſtical Writers.</p>
            <p>But his <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Writers</hi> do ſo contradict one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as renders their teſtimonies of little value. Nor is there much more reckoning to be made of the <hi>traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> account they and others give concerning the Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Government of the firſt Biſhops, than this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor makes of <hi>Euſebius</hi> his <hi>traditional</hi> Chronology, <hi>pag.</hi> 454.

            <p>He hath no ground from Scripture to think otherwiſe of <hi>Rome</hi> (that we may take in all his Scripture inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces together) however he would perſwade us that there were ſeveral Congregations there in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times. Let us ſee how. <q>By the multitude of Salutations in the end of that Epiſtle he makes appear the numbers of Chriſtians in that City. Salute <hi>Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilla</hi> and <hi>Aquila</hi> with the Church that is in their houſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Dean of Pauls</hi> will have this Church in their houſe to be but a <hi>Family,</hi> this Author will have it to be a <hi>Congregation,</hi> as if it might be either to ſerve a turn. I think it was ſuch a Congregation as removed with <hi>Aquila</hi> from one Countrey to another, for this Church which was in their houſe at <hi>Epheſus</hi> before, (1 <hi>Cor</hi> 16.) is ſaid to be in their houſe at <hi>Rome, Rom.</hi> 16. that is, there were ſome of the Church which belonged to their
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95960:44"/> Family. It is a queſtion whether there was now at <hi>Rome</hi> any one Congregation ſuch as our Author intends, <hi>Grotius</hi> 
               <note n="i" place="margin">
                  <hi>In Rom.</hi> 16.</note> thinks it probable <hi>there was none at all.</hi> But let us ſuppoſe this to be a Congregation, where finds he his ſeveral others? why where another perſon would ſcarce dream of any? <q>It is not improbable, ſaith he, that ſeveral that are mentioned with all <hi>the Saints that are with</hi> them, may be the Officers of ſeveral Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, <hi>pag.</hi> 457. 458.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But it is manifeſt that in the Apoſtle's times one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation had many Officers, how then can ſeveral Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers be a good Medium to prove ſeveral Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? The antient Authors which count thoſe Officers (mentioned <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.) do make them <hi>Biſhops</hi> (and ſome except not <hi>Narciſſus</hi> nor <hi>Priſca,</hi> i. e. <hi>Priſcilla,</hi> tho' her Husband alſo hath an Epiſcopal Chair aſſigned him) Now if they were not Biſhops at <hi>Rome</hi> but other places, they are alledged to no purpoſe; if they were Biſhops at <hi>Rome,</hi> there will be very <hi>many</hi> Biſhops in that <hi>one</hi> Church (it may be more than <hi>Priſcilla</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation conſiſted of) which rather than our Author will grant, I ſuppoſe he will quit his plurality of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations here. Indeed what he adds next doth no waies favour them, and this number was afterwards <q>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed conſiderably by the coming of <hi>Paul,</hi> who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted ſome of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and afterwards received all that came, whether Jew's or Gentiles, and preached to them the Kingdom of God for the ſpace of two whole years, no man forbidding him, <hi>pag.</hi> 458.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>his hired houſe for two years,</hi> all this while he received <hi>all that came</hi> to him; there is no queſtion but that all the Chriſtians there did come to hear this moſt eminent Apoſtle: ſo that it ſeems from firſt to laſt there were no more Chriſtians at <hi>Rome</hi> than a private Houſe could receive.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:95960:44"/>
            <p> He would prove what he intends from <hi>Nero</hi>'s Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, <q>who is ſaid to have put an infinite multitude of Chriſtians to death upon pretence that they had fired <hi>Rome,</hi> pag. 458. <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans as guilty, and ſayes they confeſſed the Crime, and detected many others.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now thoſe who ſuffered, either confeſſed that they fired <hi>Rome</hi> and then they were no Chriſtians; or they did not confeſs it, and then he wrongs them intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and deſerves no credit. But our Author to excuſe him (againſt the ſenſe of ſuch who beſt underſtand him, <hi>Lipſius</hi> particularlay, beſides <hi>Baronius</hi> and others) ſayes, <hi>they confeſſed not that they</hi> burn't <hi>Rome, but that they were Chriſtians.</hi> Whereas the inquiry being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the burning of <hi>Rome,</hi> the queſtion was not whether they were <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> but whether they <hi>fired</hi> the City, of this laſt <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaks, and will be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by thoſe who think he ſpeaks pertinently. But for truth in thoſe accounts he gives of Chriſtians, it is no more to be expected than from other Heathen Authors of thoſe Ages, with whom it is cuſtomary on that ſubject <hi>ſplendidè mentiri.</hi> Some other inſtances here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have in this report of <hi>Tacitus,</hi> which I ſuppoſe our Author will ſcarce offer to excuſe, as when the Chriſtian Religion is called <hi>Exitiabilis ſuperſtitio,</hi> and when the Chriſtians are ſaid <hi>per flagitia inviſos vulgô fuiſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe he ſpeaks truth, what is it he ſayes? Nero <hi>put an infinite multitude of them to death,</hi> but <hi>ingens multitudo,</hi> which are his words, may be far leſs than an <hi>infinite multitude.</hi> Two or three hundred may paſs for a great multitude, and extraordinarily great, when that which is ſpoke of them is extraordinary. The Martyrs burnt in Queen <hi>Mary's</hi> dayes were a <hi>great multitude;</hi> and few may be accounted very many, to
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95960:45"/> ſuffer in ſuch a manner, as theſe did by <hi>Nero's</hi> Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Ferarum tergis contecti ut laniatu canum interirent, aut crucibus affixi, aut flammandi, atque ubi defeciſſet dies in uſum nocturni luminis uterentur,</hi> in the words of <hi>Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this he adds the general account which <hi>Euſebius</hi> gives of the ſucceſs of the Chriſtian faith immediately after the firſt diſcovery of it, <hi>that preſently in all Cities and Villages Churches abounding with innumerable multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes were aſſembled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>pag.</hi> 459.</p>
            <p>If he will not deal unkindly with <hi>Euſebius</hi> he muſt not ſet his expreſſions upon the Rack, nor ſtretch them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his intention, nor forget what is obſerved to be uſual with him; <hi>Oratorem more rem amplificare.</hi> Theſe Churches conſiſting of <hi>innumerable multitudes</hi> are ſaid to be not only in <hi>all</hi> Cities, but <hi>Villages;</hi> now I believe it will be an hard matter for our Author to ſhew us any <hi>Villages,</hi> even in <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, where there were a Thouſand, yea, or 500 Chriſtians. Thoſe who will not abuſe themſelves or their Readers muſt give great allowance to ſuch expreſſions, and not rely on them in ſtrict arguing.</p>
            <p>And here it may not be amiſs to take notice of what he ſayes of <hi>Rome</hi> in another <hi>Chapter, M. B.</hi> had decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>that he found no reaſon to believe that</hi> Rome <hi>and</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandria had for 200 years more Chriſtians than ſome <hi>London</hi> Pariſhes (which have 60000 Souls) nor near, if half ſo many <note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Church Hiſt. p.</hi> 7. <hi>Vindicat. p.</hi> 27.</note>. The chief, if not the only argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove them at <hi>Rome</hi> more numerous, is a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Epiſtle ſhewing the number of the Officers and of the poor, this was in the middle of the third Age, and ſo not within theſe 200 years, but yet proves not what it is alledged for in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s time, near <hi>Anno</hi> 360. The number of Officers ſignifies no ſuch thing, as hath been made evident, the number of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95960:45"/> the poor, being 1500 rather proves the contrary. This was cleared by comparing the proportions of the poor with the reſt in other places, at <hi>Antioch</hi> in particular, as was ſhewed out of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> who reckons the poor to be a tenth part of the Inhabitants, and if it was ſo at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s time, the Chriſtians were about 15000. This will ſerve M. <hi>B</hi>'s purpoſe well enough. But the time and circumſtances being exceeding diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, makes it moſt probable that the Chriſtians then at <hi>Rome</hi> did nothing near ſo much exceed the poor in number. It is far more likely that the proportions were nearer that at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> where <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſayes, the poor was <hi>one half,</hi> this would ſpoil all our Authors pretenſions, and ſo he adviſedly takes no notice of it.</p>
            <p>However ſomething he would ſay againſt M. <hi>B.</hi> if one, could underſtand it. It is about the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Epiſtle render'd the <hi>poor. Valeſius</hi> obſerves the word is uſed by the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> in an Epiſtle to thoſe at <hi>Carthage, ſive Viduae ſive Thlibomeni,</hi> i. e. <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentes,</hi> ſaith he, as <hi>Rufinus</hi> tranſlates it, and tells us alſo that <hi>Cyprian</hi>

                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 4.</note> calls them <hi>pauperes &amp; indigentes qui labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</hi> Theſe, ſayes our Author, were not only <hi>poor, but ſick and diſeaſed,</hi> alledging that of the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> for it after <hi>Valeſius,</hi> and if he mean not only the poor, but the ſick alſo and the diſeaſed he is right, for <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> ſignifies thoſe that were maintained by the Church, Widows and Indigent whether ſick or well. But when he ſayes <hi>theſe poor were ſuch only as were not able to come abroad,</hi> he ſeems to confine it to the ſick and diſeaſed, and then it contradicts the former, and is without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, againſt the uſe and import of the word, as render'd by all Interpreters former and later that I meet with, and indeed againſt common ſenſe; for the number <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſpeaks of is fixed, as that of the <hi>Presbyters and Deacons,</hi>

            <p>The great liberality of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church is offered as no ſmall argument of its greatneſs, <hi>they ſent to a great many Churches, releiving thoſe that were in want, and ſending neceſſaries to ſuch as were condemned to the Mines;</hi> thus in <hi>Severus</hi>'s time, and in the time of <hi>Dionyſius the Provinces of</hi> Syria <hi>with</hi> Arabia <hi>were thereby relieved eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, pag.</hi> 53.</p>

               <note n="y" place="margin">Chron.</note>; and there's no probability they could rebuild them while the Perſecution laſted, or that ſo many could be raiſed in leſs than many years after. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> ſpeaks but of 14 Churches at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> in the reign of <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius</hi> junior, nor meet I with any Author that gives an account of more, yet this was about an hundred years after <hi>Byzantium</hi> was re-edifyed, and both <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> and the ſucceeding Emperours endeavoured to make that City as populous as could be, and furniſhed it with Churches anſwerable to the numbers of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants. So that there's no likelihood there could be 40 Churches in <hi>Rome</hi> at any time nearer <hi>Diocleſian</hi>'s than <hi>Optatus</hi>'s.</p>
            <p>But to help this our Author tells us out of <hi>Optatus,</hi>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:95960:48"/> that there were three <hi>Donatiſts</hi> Biſhops at <hi>Rome</hi> ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively before <hi>Macrobius,</hi> who was Contemporary with <hi>Optatus,</hi> and that the firſt of them was <hi>Victor Garbienſis,</hi> and he will have <hi>Optatus</hi> to ſpeak of the State of <hi>Rome</hi> (the 40 Churches there) not as it was in his own time, but in that of this <hi>Victor,</hi> when this was, he ſayes, is not eaſie to ſix. <hi>pag.</hi> 56.</p>
            <p>Yet this is certain, it cannot be in the time of <hi>Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi>'s <hi>Perſecution,</hi> for the Schiſme of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> did not break out till <hi>Majorinus</hi> was ordained (who was the firſt Biſhop of the Faction made in <hi>Africa</hi> or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where) and this was ſometime after the Perſecution was there ended, as <hi>Optatus</hi> and <hi>Valcſius</hi> after him, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers declare <note n="z" place="margin">

All which our Author hath to alledge for the more early date of <hi>Victor</hi>'s Biſhoprick, is that there were two or three Donatiſt Biſhops between <hi>Victor</hi> and <hi>Optatus;</hi> but this will ſcarce ſerve his turn. For there were four Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in the former part of that very age wherein we are now concerned, who held not the Chair ten years among them, <hi>Marcellus, Euſebius, Melchiades</hi> and <hi>Marcus.</hi> But we may allow the three Donatiſt Biſhop at <hi>Rome</hi> near ten years a piece from the time of <hi>Optatus,</hi> 378 (as both <hi>Blondel</hi> and <hi>Valeſius</hi> agree) and yet <hi>Victor Garbienſis</hi> may not be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop till <hi>Anno</hi> 350 and ſo nearer to <hi>Optatus</hi> his time, than <hi>Diocleſians.</hi>

            <p>2dly, It is no proof of <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Churches that thoſe who belong to it, do occaſionally divide themſelves into diſtinct Meetings, A large Church, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times

               <hi>Damaſus,</hi> the ſuppoſed Author of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>lives,</hi> ſayes, <hi>Euariſtus Titulos Presbyteris diviſit, divided the Titles in</hi> Rome <hi>to the Presbyters,</hi> and by <hi>Titles</hi> ſome will have us to underſtand <hi>Pariſh</hi> Churches.

But what is ſaid of Titles divided by <hi>Euariſtus</hi> may be true in this ſenſe, that ſince they could not ſafely meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Perſecution under <hi>Trajan,</hi> they diſperſed themſelves into diſtinct meetings, and had Presbyters aſſigned to officiate in each of them. And yet the Chriſtians at <hi>Rome</hi> were then no more, nor long after, than might all meet together for Worſhip, and did ſo when it could be done in ſafety.

            <p>2dly, The <hi>greatneſs of his Revonue</hi> is no more appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, there is nothing to prove it but the <hi>riches of that Church,</hi> and its great Revenues, and hereof our <hi>Author</hi> gives us no clear account, no value of the <hi>Numiſmata,</hi> nor is there any Evidence in the <hi>Council</hi> for the <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors</hi> he ſpeaks of but only the <hi>felling of ſome wood</hi> in a certain place there named. But where there was a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> and <hi>Archdeacons, decorum</hi> required there ſhould be <hi>Mannors</hi> and vaſt Revenues for the Biſhop. Nor do I quarrel with it, only this breaks the ſquares a little, and diſturbs the correſpondence between thoſe and our times; that if the Revenues of that Church had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to ten times more, yet the Biſhop would ſcarce have been one jot the <hi>richer</hi> for it. This will not ſeem ſtrange to any, who take notice of the antient Orders, concerning the revenues of an Epiſcopal Church. The Biſhop was to have <hi>nothing</hi> thereof if he could main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain himſelf otherwiſe.

The other proof that <hi>Ibas</hi> was a <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> viz. <hi>becauſe he had excommunicating Archdeacons,</hi> our <hi>Author</hi> would make good by telling us, <hi>that one of his Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons excommunicated</hi> Maras. Now this though it prove not what it is alledged for, may prove more than he likes. An <hi>Archdeacon</hi> in the antient Church (though he be another thing now) was not ſo much as a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> he was but in the lower Order of <hi>Deacons,</hi> though chief amongſt them, and choſen by them, as <hi>Jerome</hi> ſignifies <note n="u" place="margin">Ep. ad Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grium.</note>, <hi>Diaconi eligunt de ſe quem induſtrium noverint, &amp; Archidiaconum vocant,</hi> the <hi>Deacons chuſe from amongst themſelves one whom they know to be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious, and call him Archdeacon.</hi> Now if a Deacon had the <hi>power</hi> to <hi>excommunicate,</hi> there can be no doubt but the <hi>Presbyters</hi> had it, being of a Superiour Order and Power. And excommunication being counted the higheſt act of Juriſdiction, it cannot be queſtioned but the other acts thereof belonged to them; and ſo the <hi>Presbyters</hi> having all the Juriſdiction of <hi>Biſhops</hi> (all the power of Government) what did they want of being Biſhops but the honour of preſiding in their Aſſemblies?
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:95960:51"/> And if they were no farther from being Biſhops, they will go near to be as much <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> and ſo this <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> may chuſe, whether he will have <hi>all</hi> of both ſorts to be <hi>Dioceſans,</hi> or <hi>none</hi> of either.</p>
            <p>4ly, It is no Argument to prove a Dioceſan Church to ſhew that it conſiſts of ſuch who live at a good di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance one from another. <hi>Dionyſius</hi> had a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation at <hi>Cephro,</hi> a Village in <hi>Lybia,</hi> but thoſe which made up this Church were of another Countrey, coming partly from <hi>Alexandria,</hi> partly from other parts of <hi>Egypt,</hi> as <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſhews us, yet none ever eſteemed that to be a <hi>Dioceſan Church.</hi> In <hi>Juſtin Martyr's</hi> time thoſe that were in the Countrey, and thoſe that were in the City, when thoſe were no more than made one Congregation, met together in one place, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Our <hi>Authour</hi> would prove the largeneſs of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Dioceſs by the diſtance between <hi>Caeſarea and Saſima.</hi> *. <note place="margin">x <hi>pag.</hi> 546, 547</note> He makes much of it and takes the pains to meaſure the diſtance between theſe Towns, or rather, as he ſays, to <hi>make ſome gueſs at it out</hi> of an <hi>Itenerary</hi> and <hi>Putinger</hi>'s <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;</hi> yet tells us the diſtance muſt be as great at leaſt as between <hi>Hippo</hi> and <hi>Fuſſala,</hi> that ſo <hi>St. Baſil</hi>'s Dioceſs may be as great at leaſt as that of <hi>St Auſtin</hi>'s.

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95960:52"/> things ſhould firſt have been cleared, neither of which is (or I think can be proved; 1ſt, That <hi>Saſima</hi> was in <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Dioceſe, for if it was but only in his <hi>Province,</hi> how far ſoever it was from <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> his Dioceſe can be nothing the larger for it, though his Province might. To prove it in his Dioceſe I find nothing but his own aſſertion, that <hi>Saſima is ſaid expreſly to be taken out of the Dioceſe of</hi> Baſil; but where is this ſaid expreſly, or by whom, except by himſelf? The words in the Margin ſignify no ſuch thing, but only ſome attempt to <hi>deprive a Metropolis of</hi> Saſima. For a Metropolis may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of a Town which is in any part of the Province, when another <hi>Metropolitan</hi> ſeizeth on it. And I believe our <hi>Author</hi> is yet more <hi>out</hi> in taking the <hi>Metropolis</hi> which <hi>Nazianzen</hi> ſpeaks of to be <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> when it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by the <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to be rather <hi>Tyana.</hi> For as the whole Epiſtle is writ to <hi>Baſil,</hi> ſo theſe words cited, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter many others by way of ſharp expoſtulation, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected <hi>to him</hi> as endeavouring to deprive a <hi>Metropolis</hi> of this Town, called ironically <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>: Now <hi>Caeſarea</hi> was not the Metropolis which <hi>Baſil</hi> would have deprived of <hi>Saſima,</hi> he earneſtly endeavoured to have it annext thereto; but he would have deprived <hi>Tyana</hi> of it, if <hi>Anthimus</hi> the Metropolitan there, had not made a ſtout oppoſition. 2dly, He ſhould have prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that after this part of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> was divided into <hi>two</hi> Provinces, <hi>Saſima</hi> was in that Province which fell to <hi>Baſil</hi>'s ſhare (for if it was not in his Province how could his Dioceſe be any larger for it?) but inſtead of this our Author offers what may ſerve to diſprove it, telling us that in the antient <hi>Greek Notitia, Saſima</hi> is ſet down in the <hi>ſecond Cappadocia</hi> (which belonged to <hi>Anthimus</hi> as the firſt did to <hi>Baſil) and ſo,</hi> ſayes he, <hi>it is not likely to be very near</hi> Caeſarea. No indeed, it is thereby proved to be ſo far from <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> that it did
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95960:52"/> not enlarge <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Province, much leſs his Dioceſe. Thus it is alſo placed in the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Leo Sophus</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Metropolitan of <hi>Tyana,</hi> not of <hi>Caeſarea.</hi> It is true <hi>Baſil</hi> laid claim to it, but after ſome conteſt he yeilded, and <hi>Anthimus</hi> carried it, placing <hi>Eulalius</hi> there as one of his Suffragans, when <hi>Nazianzen</hi> had quitted it.</p>
            <p>He goes farther on to ſhew the largeneſs of Dioceſes in <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Province.</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is plain by <hi>Nazianzen</hi> that <hi>Cappadocia</hi> had but 50 Biſhops, for ſo many he ſayes <hi>Baſil</hi> had under him, and conſidering the extent of that Countrey the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes muſt needs be large.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He does not ſay <hi>Baſil</hi> had no more under him, nor that he was making no more; he knew <hi>Baſil</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting more Biſhops in that part of <hi>Cappadocia</hi> which was his Province, and <hi>Nazianzen</hi> commends him for it as an excellent undertaking on ſeveral accounts <note n="y" place="margin">Orat. de Bal.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Conſidering the extent of that Countrey, the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes muſt needs be large, for the Countrey as <hi>Strabo</hi> computes, is near 400 miles in length, and little leſs in breadth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If he means <hi>Baſil</hi>'s own Province, where he told us there were 50 Suffragans under him beſides <hi>Saſima,</hi> &amp;c <note n="z" place="margin">

               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:95960:53"/> (afterwards called <hi>Caeſarea)</hi> being Metropolis of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s and <hi>Tyana</hi> of <hi>Tyanitis,</hi> &amp;c. and after he hath given ſome account of theſe <hi>ten Praefectures,</hi> he adds the dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the whole Countrey, in theſe words, <hi>the extent of</hi> Cappadocia <hi>in breadth from the</hi> Euxine <hi>to</hi> Taurus, <hi>is</hi> 1800 <hi>Furlongs, in length</hi> 3000. So that our <hi>Author</hi> will have the extent of <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Province to be no leſs than that of the <hi>whole Countrey,</hi> when it is but the <hi>tenth part</hi> thereof. And as if this were not enough, he makes the breadth of the whole Countrey, to be near twice as much as it is in <hi>Strabo;</hi> but he hath ſome ſalvo for this, ſuch as it is.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And little leſs in breadth, as <hi>Cauſabon</hi> reſtores the reading of 1800 Furlongs in the 12th. <hi>Book,</hi> by a paſſage in the <hi>ſecond</hi> where the breadth is made 2800.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is true <hi>Cauſabon</hi> obſerves ſome difference in the places cited, but he ſhews how they may be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, without changing the Text here, or making the Countrey broader than it is here deſcribed, <hi>viz.</hi> by taking <hi>Pontus</hi> in one place for the <hi>Sea,</hi> in the other for the <hi>Region</hi> ſo called, ſeparated from <hi>Cappadocia by mountains parallel to</hi> Taurus; and then concludes, <hi>Sic non erit diſcedendum à vulgatâ lectione.</hi> So that he hath no relief by <hi>Cauſabon</hi> without curtailing the Paſſage.</p>
            <p>
               <q>And in this compaſs Biſhops may contrive 50 Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes of very competent extent, and not inferiour to many of ours.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let him try how in <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Province of about 40 miles in length, he can <hi>contrive</hi> room for above 50 Biſhops, with as large Dioceſes as thoſe he pleads for.

            <p> What Dioceſes <hi>Baſil</hi> (and others before him) thought ſufficient for Biſhops both then, and in formertimes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a paſſage which our <hi>Author</hi> next cites, where <hi>Amphilochius Biſhop of Iconium, is directed to conſtitute Biſhops for the Province of Iconium, in little Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Villages.</hi> 
               <note n="a" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ep.</hi> 406.</note> Hundreds of inſtances might be brought of Biſhops elſewhere, in <hi>ſuch little places and Villages,</hi> but I will go no further now, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance himſelf offers us, whereby it is manifeſt that a <hi>little Corporation, or a Village</hi> might furniſh a Biſhop with ſuch a Dioceſe, as was then thought competent, both by <hi>Baſil,</hi> and the Church <hi>before him.</hi> For in ſuch <hi>lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle places</hi> there was Biſhops before, as <hi>Baſil</hi> there ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, and he gives direction that it ſhould be ſo ſtill.

            <p>Hereby alſo it appears that the <hi>multiplying of Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans</hi> was no ſuch occaſion of <hi>multiplying Biſhops,</hi> but that their numbers <hi>increaſed,</hi> when there was not that occaſion; And this in <hi>Cappadocia,</hi> which is our <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's</hi> eminent inſtance. <note n="b" place="margin">

And when there can be no ſuch pretence of occaſion from the <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> the practice was continued, as appears by <hi>St. Auſtin</hi>'s procuring a Biſhop for <hi>Fuſſala,</hi> which he calls a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> upon ſome increaſe of the <hi>Catholicks</hi> there, diverſe years after the noted <hi>conference</hi> at <hi>Carthage,</hi> where the heart of the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> was broken; Nay, many years after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of the <hi>Vandals,</hi> and the death of <hi>St. Auſtin</hi> they proceeded in the ſame methods, or rather exceeded their Predeceſſors in multiplying Biſhops, by erecting Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ſeats in ſmaller, and more inconſiderable places, if <hi>Leo</hi> his Epiſtle may be credited. <note n="d" place="margin">

<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95960:54"/> that one Province is part of another, yet <hi>Iſauria</hi> would rather be part of <hi>Amphilochius</hi> his province, who (as he tells us) was to <hi>conſtitute</hi> a Metropolitan and other Biſhops therein, than of <hi>Baſil's,</hi> who is only repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as giving <hi>advice</hi> about it.

            <p>He adds, that which, if it were true, wouldgo near to <hi>dethrone</hi> theſe <hi>Countrey Biſhops;</hi> (for <hi>Baſil</hi> ſpeaks of them, as having their <hi>Thrones</hi> in Villages) and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them leſs than antient Presbyters, for all their <hi>large Territory,</hi> and there being <hi>Dioceſans.</hi>

            <p>Theſe and ſuch like are uſed as good arguments for <hi>Dioceſan Churches,</hi> whereas there are diverſe Towns in <hi>England,</hi> which beſides the Officers in them, have <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Congregations and Presbyters in Villages belonging to them, and contained within the Pariſh; and yet our Author and thoſe of his perſwaſion would think <hi>Dioceſans</hi> quite ruined, if they were reduced, and confined to the meaſures of thoſe Pariſh Churches, and left no bigger than ſome of our Vicarages and Parſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, though ſuch as Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> affirms to <hi>be as large as ſome antient Biſhopricks;</hi> he might have ſaid <hi>moſt,</hi> there being not one in many greater or ſo large.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:95960:57"/> they were after <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> when Biſhops were much multiplied; (as he muſt underſtand it, if he expect any ſervice from it) wants proof, and he offers none but ſome paſſages in <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſtrained far beyond what is agreeable to other <hi>antient Authors,</hi> of which before. Let me add that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> comparing the numbers of Chriſtians in former times, with thoſe in <hi>Julian</hi>'s Reign, ſays, they were <hi>not many</hi> in former Perſecutions, (Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity had not reached many, <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>,) no, not in that of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> &amp;c. (though they were at that time, farr more numerous, than in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s age) but that Chriſtianity was found only in a few <gap reason="foreign">

The <hi>other part</hi> which needs no proof, ſince it is granted, (and may be without any advantage to him) he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to prove largely and induſtriouſly; but by ſuch a <hi>medium</hi> as makes that which is granted to be queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, ſuch a one which as it is ordered may conclude backward, and prove the contrary to what he deſigns. That this may be manifeſt, let it be obſerved, that he will have us take an account of the number of Biſhops in the Church by their appearing in <hi>Councils,</hi> more or fewer; and accordingly judge in ſeveral periods, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were leſs numerous, and conſequently their Dioceſes larger in former times than afterwards. And to this purpoſe we need view no other inſtances than himſelf produces. At <hi>Lambeſe</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi> there were 90 Biſhops againſt <hi>Privatus;</hi> but not ſo many in any Council after (though not a few are mentioned in that Countrey) till the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> grew numerous <note n="d" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 509.</note>. In <hi>Spain</hi> the Council of <hi>Eliberis</hi> had 19 Biſhops in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 4th. Age, and the firſt Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> had no more in the beginning of the age after. But the following Synods, at <hi>Saragoſſa, Gerunda, Ilerda, Valentia, Arragon,</hi> had not ſo many <note n="e" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 557. 558</note>. In <hi>France</hi> the Council at <hi>Valence</hi> had 21 Biſhops in the fourth Age,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95960:57"/> but thoſe following them, in that and the after ages had ſtill fewer, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>Riez, Orange,</hi> the third of <hi>Arles,</hi> that at <hi>Angers,</hi> that at <hi>Tours,</hi> and <hi>Vennes</hi> and another at <hi>Arles.</hi> For <hi>General</hi> Councils, the firſt at <hi>Nice</hi> had 318 Biſhops in the beginning of the fourth Age, that at <hi>Epheſus</hi> above an hundred yearsafter, had but two hundred, that at <hi>C. P.</hi> in the latter end of the fourth Age had but one hundred and fifty Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops.</p>
            <p>So that if we take account how many Biſhops there were of old, as he would have us, by <hi>their numbers in Councils,</hi> there will be more before the middle of the third Age, than in the beginning of the fourth; more in the beginning of the fourth than in ſome part of the fifth; and more in the beginning of the fifth, than in ſome part of the ſixth; quite contrary to the <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> on which he proceeds. Whether by his argument he would lead us to think <hi>Dioceſes</hi> did wax and wane ſo odly, as it makes Biſhops to be more or fewer, I cannot tell. However ſince he grants that in the fourth and fifth Ages <hi>Dioceſes</hi> were <hi>very ſmall</hi> 
               <note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 552.</note>, and <hi>crumbled into ſmall pieces</hi> 
               <note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>pag.</hi> 516.</note>, (and ſo nothing like ours): there's no expectation he can find any larger, if any thing near ſo great, in any former age: unleſs they can be larger when incomparably fewer Chriſtians belonged to theſe Biſhops; which will be no leſs a paradox than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. For it cannot but be thought ſtrange, that the Biſhops Dioceſe ſhould be <hi>greater</hi> when his flock was undeniably far <hi>leſs.</hi> And they ſeem not to be <hi>Chriſtian Biſhopricks,</hi> whoſe meaſures muſt be taken by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of <hi>Acres</hi> rather than of <hi>Souls;</hi> or by multitudes of Heathens rather than Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>He denies not, that <hi>the generality of Biſhops, for a long while after the Apoſtles,</hi> had <hi>but one Congregation to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</hi> 
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Pag.</hi> 71.</note> What then? ſays he, <hi>If all the Beleivers in and</hi>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:95960:58"/> 
               <hi>about a City would hardly make a Congregation, that is to be aſcribed to the condition of thoſe times.</hi> Dioceſes with him, were largeſt in the firſt times; but Biſhops being ſtill multiplyed, they became leſs and leſs, and ſo were very ſmall and crumbled into very little pieces in the fourth and fifth Ages. This is the tendency of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe all along. Thus Dioceſes muſt be largeſt, when a Biſhop had but one Congregation; but in after ages when he had more Congregations under his inſpection Dioceſes were very ſmall. If he will ſtand to this, our differences may be eaſily compromized. Let him and thoſe of his perſwaſion, be content with the Dioceſes in the firſt ages, when he counts them largeſt; and we ſhall never trouble any to reduce them to the meaſures of the fourth and fifth ages, when in his account they were ſo lamentably <hi>little,</hi> and <hi>crumbled ſo very ſmall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particulars premiſed contain enough to ſatisfie <hi>all,</hi> that I have yet ſeen alledged out of Antiquity for <hi>Dioceſan Churches,</hi> ſo that no more is needful, yet let me add another, which will ſhew there is a <hi>medium</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Congregational</hi> and <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Churches. So that if ſome Churches ſhould be ſhewed out of the <hi>Antients</hi> exceeding the <hi>Congregational meaſures</hi> (as ſome there were in the times of the four firſt General Councils) yet it cannot thence be immediately inferred that they were <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> ſince they may prove a <hi>third</hi> ſort of Churches, and ſuch as will as little pleaſe thoſe of this Gentleman's perſwaſion as <hi>Congregational.</hi>

            <p>Finally, the Presbyters are in the antient Church ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to have had the <hi>power of the keys,</hi> both as to the miniſtration of the Word and Sacraments, and <hi>the exerciſe of Government and cenſures.</hi> This power they exerciſed either jointly in conjunction with the Biſhop and Senate of Presbyters; or <hi>diſtinctly</hi> in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Churches whereof they had the charge.
